INTRODUCTION

 

Last week, I met my old Cikgu, Haji Amin Shafawi. He taught me Malay when I was a kid. He is now a robust 67 years old, happy to be at the Istana for the swearing-in. I was delighted to meet him again, and in good health too. We exchanged news of our families.�
 
Cikgu Amin is now retired, as is his wife, Cikgu Jamilah Ghazali. His three children are all grown and married.� They are graduates and professionals, with four cucu.� They are scattered and working in different countries, but �they�ll come home, this is their home,� he quickly added with a beaming smile.
 
It is more than 40 years since my lessons with him, and also nearly 40 years since Singa�pore�s independence.� In one generation, Cikgu Amin's family went from being teachers of Malay in Singa�pore to be an international and globalised family.
 
Cikgu Amin�s story is the story of many families in Singapore.� The progress of Singapore made it possible.� We overcame many challenges, and grew our economy. Our society became more open and mature. Our people grew with the opportunities, and spread their wings. We united into one nation, and had our share of ups and downs.
 

PROGRESSING THROUGH THE YEARS

 
We made progress because we have had good leaders working hand in hand with stout hearted people, rising up to meet the various challenges.� Malay MPs and community leaders have played their part, mobilising opinion, setting priorities, and doing community work. Your close rapport with the Govern�ment, and particularly with Mr Goh Chok Tong, has helped us to tackle difficult issues, and brought progress for our society.
 
A new generation of Singa�pore Malays is emerging. I have met many of them, at community functions, in tea sessions, and when visiting mosques. They are well educated, confident, and capable.� They are lawyers and engineers, senior civil servants and SAF officers, technicians and nurses.� Others have distinguished themselves in social work, in the arts and sports. They participate actively in the mainstream of our society. They are committed to Singapore, and are proud of their achievements under our system of meritocracy. They are role models for the community, and hold their head high as Singaporeans, anywhere in the world.
 
At community events, the new generation Malays are working hard to help the community progress further in education and careers, and to tackle its social problems.
 
In dialogue sessions on sensitive matters, Malay community leaders participate actively, presenting their views and concerns. They want a Malay community that is progressive and tolerant.
 
In Parliament, I have observed how over the years the Malay MPs have changed their focus. Instead of speaking mainly on Malay and Muslim issues, they now participate actively in debates on national matters, speaking as Singaporeans on behalf of all their constituents.
 
Key to this progress is the effort which Malay parents and the community are making to educate their children.� Efforts by Mendaki and other community organisations like Jamiyah, Pertapis, AMP, 4PM, and PPIS have also helped weaker students and their families.�
 
Overall, our Malay community has made great progress, which the community, and Singapore, are proud of.� However, one segment of the community still faces problems.� Drug abuse has declined, but there are still too many broken families. Poorly skilled workers are at risk of losing their jobs, and find it harder to find new jobs.� They need new skills. In my Meet-the-People sessions, I do meet such families.� I worry especially for their children and their studies.�
 
We must help these children, so that the next generation can have a better life.� We need to encourage poor parents with low education to take advantage of the HOPE scheme. Then they can concentrate their limited resources to give their children the best education and chance in life.� When their children succeed, they can also care for their parents in old age.
 
At the same time, we have to encourage the more successful Malay families who can afford it to have more children. These Malay families are having too few children, just like among the Chinese and Indians. This is a difficult and sensitive national problem which affects all the communities in Singapore, and which we must solve, together. I will discuss this further in my English speech later.
 

UNITY IN DIVERSITY

 
Our Malay Singaporeans are a key part of our society, contributing and doing their best for their fellowmen. In crises, they respond and pull together with other Singaporeans.
 
After the September 11 terrorist attacks, Singaporeans of all races responded strongly to condemn the attacks.� When we discovered the JI terrorists in Singapore, we dealt with the problem calmly and rationally. We treated it as a security issue.
 
During SARS, Malay nurses served alongside Chinese and Indian nurses.�
 
When a section of the Nicoll Highway collapsed, an SCDF DART Team carried out the difficult and dangerous recovery operation.� They were led by Major Kadir Maideen Mohamed.� They risked their lives to search and rescue victims who were trapped. As a DART Section Commander, SSG Hamdan Tahir, said, �I have been watching television news, and I have seen the families pleading for their loved ones to be safe.� I kept that image in my mind when I was working.�
 
When these brave Singaporeans receive National Day awards for valour and outstanding contributions, Singaporeans of all races join me to salute them. Clearly we were one, regardless of race, language or religion.
 

GOING FORWARD

 
We should continue expanding the common ground between our races, and strengthening our shared Singaporean values and identity.� The Malay community must participate in the national effort to restructure our economy, upgrade our workers, and create more rewarding jobs.
 
Our vision is a successful Malay community, modern and forward looking, mastering science and technology, but at the same time maintaining its customs and way of life;
 
A community that plays a full role in nation building, and contributes to the harmony and strength of Singapore society;
 
A community that takes full advantage of the many opportunities that Singa�pore offers for citizens to improve their lives.
 
In the coming years, I hope to see our Malays make further progress. I will build upon the good progress that you have made under Mr Goh Chok Tong.� I value your thoughts and suggestions. I am confident that you will continue to work hard to tackle this challenge head on. Together with our Malay Ministers, MPs and community leaders, I will work with you to realise our vision of a Community of Excellence.�
