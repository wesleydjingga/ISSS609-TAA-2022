Introduction

Singapore is thriving and in good shape.

We enjoyed three consecutive years of growth, and expect another good year.

Current turbulence in global financial markets.
Singapore�s stock market fell in recent days.
We are monitoring this closely.
The impact on the global economy is not yet clear.
If consumer confidence weakens in US, then the economies in Asia and Singapore will be affected.
But the economic fundamentals for Asia and Singapore remain strong.
Hence I believe that our prospects for the medium to long-term are very good.

So far this year, we have enjoyed good growth in many areas.
Tourism is growing strongly.  Last year, a record high of nearly 10 million tourists visited Singapore.
In other industries, many companies are doing well. Profits are up.  Workers are receiving better pay and higher bonuses.
As a result, the retail sector is getting better.  Perhaps, this was also due to the distribution of the GST Offset Package last month.
Even the seventh month groups are active and bustling.  According to newspaper reports, �getai� stage fees are higher.
Of course, everyone knows that the property market is going up � some are happy, while others are sad.
Importance of Multi-Lingualism  .

One reason for our success is our understanding of languages and culture around our neighbourhood. 

In particular, our ability to speak and write Mandarin is a major asset when we do business in China. 
Many Singapore companies and Singaporeans are all over China. They have paid their �tuition fees� and are now doing well.
For example, Hyflux has 25 major projects in China, dealing with water treatment and desalination.  With NEWater, we have turned a disadvantage into a strength, and we recently won the Stockholm Industry Water Prize.  Singaporeans worked together, overcame the odds, and gained international recognition. This focus has also helped Hyflux in its ventures in China.
CapitaLand is investing and managing 72 malls in China.  Three of the malls are called �Raffles Cities�. The one in Shanghai is among the busiest.
Singaporeans are also doing very well in Shanghai. 
There are 10,000 of us in Shanghai, and many have made significant inroads into the market.
There are also many Singapore brands, for example, Bee Cheng Hiang, Breadtalk and Food Republic etc.

While Singaporeans go to China to look for opportunities, many Chinese are also coming to Singapore. There are a million Chinese tourists a year. Chinese officials are coming here to learn how we do things.  There is one major reason for choosing Singapore � they are very comfortable here; they face no language barriers and are familiar with our social norms. 

We must press on with efforts to maintain high standards of Mandarin, and to popularise its use.  With nearly 30 years of history, SAP schools play an important role in promoting Mandarin.
SAP schools have set their direction and put in place many plans. I believe they will nurture many bilingual and bicultural talents.
The bicultural programmes are very popular.
This year, over 900 students in schools and JCs have enrolled in the programme.  Next year, there will be more.
In Tao Nan Primary, students in the Bicultural Elective Programme use Chinese for many lessons.  About 40% of the students� curriculum time is in Chinese.
Another example is Hwa Chong Institution, which has set up a satellite campus in Beijing.   All students on the bicultural programme have the opportunity to study in Beijing and be immersed in the environment there for several months.
These new approaches are innovative, popular and effective. They show that our SAP schools are continually changing and improving.  They will not let down the expectations of the community.
MOE will continue to give full support to SAP schools, help them to strengthen the teaching of Chinese language and culture, so that they can pass on the torch to the next generation.

SCCCI also plays a crucial role in the task of promoting Chinese. 
SCCCI is taking the lead to set up a new club called �Business China�. 
The club will bring together those interested in China, including businessmen, professionals, young entrepreneurs and students, so that they will have a chance to network and interact, and use Mandarin to discuss important issues.
MM has agreed to be its Patron, while DPM Wong Kan Seng and other Ministers will serve as Advisors.
This demonstrates the Government�s support for this plan.

We will also do more to encourage civil servants to stay current in Mandarin. 
Our diplomats need to be good in different languages.  In MFA, officers receive an allowance if they maintain proficiency in languages for purposes of work. 
But in fact other ministries like MTI, MND and Civil Service College also have extensive contacts with foreign countries.  Yet officers in these ministries do not receive this allowance. 
We will therefore extend the language allowance to these agencies. 
The allowance will give them a tangible incentive to maintain their language skills. 
I expect many officers will choose Mandarin, because of its practical value. 
This is in line with the Government�s commitment to promote the use of Mandarin.
Besides Mandarin, we also need other languages, especially Malay.
Singapore is located in Southeast Asia.  Hence we need to encourage more Singaporeans to learn Malay or Bahasa Indonesian. Then we can interact with our neighbours, do business with them, and improve mutual understanding.
We will incentivise more non-Malays to learn Malay. This will be a third language, and will not replace your mother tongue. I will elaborate more on this in English later.
I should emphasise that our mother tongue policy remains the same.
It is natural for the next generation to learn Chinese.
Recent newspaper commentaries highlighted that economics should not be the motive for learning Chinese.
I agree it should not be the sole motive.
But the rise of China is encouraging many people to take Chinese seriously.  Around the world, there is a strong interest, and millions are learning Chinese.
We must take full advantage, and get more people to master the language. 

Widening Income Gap

While Singa­pore�s prospects are good, we still face some challenges.
One of them is the widening income gap.   
The Government has often raised this, and also done a lot to help the poor.
But we seldom bring together all that we are doing to give a full explanation to the people. 
One major strategy is home ownership.
Nearly every citizen owns his own home, including lower-income Singaporeans.
A three-room flat is worth $160,000, or more.
For the lower-income, it is a significant asset which can be drawn on to support their old age.
Another major strategy is good education to maximise the potential of our young, and equip them with the skills to make a living.
In addition, we have also undertaken many concrete measures in the last few years to help the poor.
E.g. ComCare, the Additional CPF Housing Grant and Workfare.
We will continue to explore new and effective policies.  I will elaborate more in my English speech.

But the Government by itself cannot solve this problem. 
Everyone must play a part.
Chinese community pioneers were heavily influenced by Confucian values to help others.
This includes people like Tan Kah Kee, Lee Kong Chian, Tan Tock Seng etc.
They contributed generously and left behind lasting legacies. 
I hope that the new generation of Singaporeans, especially those who have been successful, will continue to uphold this philanthropic spirit.
Many are already doing so.
Two examples are the Khoo Teck Puat family and Sim Wong Hoo.
They have recently donated generously to public causes.
The meaning of charity does not lie in the amount of your contributions. Everyone should contribute in accordance with his means. 
In the community, seventh month organisers have always been supportive of charity. 
They organise charity auctions every year, and donate the money to charitable organisations or community welfare funds.
Their efforts have contributed to the warmth and care in our community.

Why can�t we leave the responsibility of looking after the poor to the Government?
Because in any place the selfless acts of philanthropists can move people, and set an example for others to follow. 
No government official can have such influence.
I remember the late Mr Ee Peng Liang � he was Chairman of the Community Chest for many years, devoted his life to charity, and even called himself a professional beggar. 
He told me once how he once had to admonish somebody who came to him for help, because he felt that the man was not making the effort to help himself. 
Mr Ee had the moral authority to scold this man. No bureaucrat (not even an MP or minister) could have done the same as effectively. 
Our society must have philanthropists, and uphold the public and civic spirit.

Challenges of Ageing Population

One factor in the widening income gap is our ageing population. 
Over the next 20 years, our society will age and we will have many more older people.
We must help them to prepare for old age early. Otherwise, it will be too late, and many will face difficulties. 
This is why I have appointed Lim Boon Heng to be fully in charge of ageing issues. 

First, we must attend to the daily living needs of the elderly.
We are leveraging on technology to make life easier for the elderly.
The Japanese are very good at this.  They have many useful gadgets to make living more comfortable for old folks.
One invention is a kettle that can send SMS.  Whenever the elderly uses the kettle, his family members receive an SMS.  If the usage pattern goes down, or if it is not used for 1-2 days, the family will know that there is a problem.
Another invention is a handphone (called �Raku-Raku� or �easy-easy�) that slows down the caller�s voice to make it easier for the elderly to hear what is being said.  
We should learn from the Japanese, and introduce these innovations to help the elderly.

Old folks also need social activities.
Community and grassroots organisations can do more; the Government will facilitate. 
All over Singa­pore, senior citizens� groups are very popular.  They do activities like taiqi quan, qigong, and karaoke.
Experts say that mah jong can help to prevent Alzheimer�s disease.
All these activities are good for your health. 
I hope that our old folks will lead fulfilling and happy lives.
No matter how old you are, you can still pursue your own interests.
If you have no health problems, then continue to work.  
It will help with your finances, and will also be good for your health, both mentally and physically. 

Finances are important for enjoying your golden years.
We are living longer. So we should retire later.
In addition, the Government will improve the CPF scheme.  I will explain later in English.

I know some older Singaporeans feel that their retirement is getting further and further away.
The Government encourages our people to work longer.
They worry that they will need to work for their whole life.
They blame this on the Govern­ment, saying that high cost of living gives them no choice.  
But we need to change our mindsets because times have changed.
The Tang poet Du Fu wrote �Since ancient times it is rare for anyone to reach 70�.
But that was 1300 years ago.
Today in China, there is a common saying � �70 is a little brother, many are 80, and 90 is no longer rare�.
To be 70 years old today, is like being 60 or even 50 in the past.

Besides working longer, we also need to consider the family aspects of ageing. 
Nowadays, once young people have found their match, they will apply for a HDB flat first. Then when they are about to collect the keys to the flat, they will register with the ROM. After that, they will conduct their customary wedding ceremony, and move out to their new home. They no longer live with their parents.
Perhaps they feel �Good to meet, hard to live together�.
Sometimes it is good for parents and their children to live apart. 
However, MPs often see families who refuse to stay together even when facing financial difficulties.  Every family has its own set of problems.
But old folks will face more inconveniences as they get older. It is not ideal for them to stay on their own. 
On my home visits, I see more and more elderly Singaporeans living on their own, either an old couple together, or sometimes just one person alone after the spouse has passed away.
I worry for them.

While the times are different, families are still important. 
Young people should care for their parents, keep them company, and look after them if they fall ill.
When they grow old, bring them back into the home to take care of them. 
No matter how efficient the Government or old folks� home, it can never replace the love and warmth of family members. 

Conclusion

In any country there are bound to be difficult issues.
In Singapore, the Government has always explained thorny issues, and looked for solutions, and worked to persuade people to adapt.
Over the last forty years, we have pressed forward as a people with determination.
Through our decisive reforms, we have a strong foundation for our nation�s development.

Today, Singapore is in a very strong position. Asia is changing at an unprecedented pace, and bringing boundless opportunities.
We must seize the moment to accelerate our growth and pace of reforms. 
In the next 10 years, Singapore will be completely transformed and become more vibrant.
Let us work together to create a brighter future for all.
