2004_eng.txt,1," 
Friends and fellow Singaporeans, I've known Mr Goh Chok Tong for a very long time, more than 25 years.  We first met in 1978.  It was not long after he entered politics.  We met socially and I remember he was explaining to me how he was consciously staying away from making speeches on shipping matters because he was from NOL (Neptune Orient Lines) and he wanted to broaden out and talk about other subjects. Soon after I met him, I went away to the US to study.  When I was away, I needed to make a presentation on Singapore – Know Your World – and wanted something to show the Americans what Singapore was like.  So, I asked Mr Goh and he sent me some slides of activities in Marine Parade, a kite-flying competition, something you won't find in America and it added something to letting the Americans know us.  I came back from America after two years in the SAF (Singapore Armed Forces).  He was my minister.  I would brief him regularly. Then I entered Cabinet and he was a colleague and then, he was the Prime Minister.

2004_eng.txt,2,"When Mr Goh took over from Mr Lee Kuan Yew as PM, many people wondered how he would work out because Singapore had had onlyone PM ever since it was independent, in fact, ever since before it was independent.  What would the new PM be like?  Would he be his own man? What mark would he put on Singapore?  All this uncertainty was soon dispelled.  Chok Tong established his own style, milder, gentler, consultative and inclusive, but firm and clear.  He built his own team.  He retained key members from his own generation to help with the transition.  He brought in new and younger ministers and he got good men and women to work with him and formed a strong team.  And I'd just like to mention two of the people who kept on and stayed with him.  One is Mr Dhanabalan, who had actually gone into the private sector after the transition was completed and came back in again when I was ill with lymphoma in 1992 and took over from me in MTI (Ministry of Trade and Industry) and looked after MTI for one year, one crucial year, and helped out at a very difficult time.  And the other one is Dr Tony Tan, who also went out after the transition into the private sector, but came back in 1995 because Chok Tong asked him to help run Mindef (Ministry of Defence) for two years.  And he stayed for nine years and now, he's staying for another year to help me out with my transition.  So, I owe them a thank you.

2004_eng.txt,3,"Chok Tong launched new policies to take Singapore forward.  Some were popular policies, like Edusave and Medifund.  Everybody liked them.  Some were difficult but necessary policies.  We had to cut the CPF (Central Provident Fund), we had to raise the GST (Goods and Services Tax), not popular, but we had to do it and Chok Tong sold these policies and persuaded people to do it.  Many things were in foreign policy.  He travelled, he made friends with foreign leaders, he established contacts, gained their respect and made use of these links for our advantage, for example, establishing many free trade agreements with important trading partners and I should just mention one, the US free trade agreement because that one was born on a golf course.  One evening after dinner, he persuaded Bill Clinton to play golf in Bandar Seri Begawan at night and over 18 holes, a free trade agreement was born.  So, that means he's telling me I should play golf.

If you look at the employment rates, the percentage of older people working, the men, aged 55 and above, say 55 to 64 years old, the group who are most vulnerable and at risk of being retired early, their employment rates have gone up dramatically this year.  A lot more of them are at work again which is good but we must not slacken because asSwee Say reminds me, we have gone through this cycle several times.

You know about Israel and the war they have fought with Hizbollah which has altered perceptions of the Israeli defence forces in the Middle East and is going to have long term consequences.  The problems are far from over.  It’s because of the uncertainties in the Middle East, that is why today oil is US$70 plus a barrel and in Singapore electricity is expensive and bus fares have to go up.  It’s not that there’s not enough oil.  It’s the fear, the uncertainty, the risk that’s keeping the oil prices high and hurting us.  But if something goes wrong in the Middle East and there is a flare up, oil prices will not stay at US$70.  They may go to US$120, they may double to US$150.  I think it will have a very big impact on us.  It will have a big impact on the whole world, create a global recession.  We have to be psychologically prepared for that.  The lower income groups we can help them.  We have Utilities Save, we have various schemes, many schemes to help the lower income.  We have been doing it, it has been helpful.

One, we have to maintain strong links with the Singaporeans who are abroad, with our overseas network so that they become a strength for us and not a loss.  Two, we need to encourage, make sure that we have enough babies and three, we need immigration, welcome talent to come to Singapore.  I will only talk about our overseas network briefly and then talk about immigration becausebabies is a subject you know about.  It’s just a matter of having the babies.  First of all, overseas Singaporeans, we have got to keep in touch with our network overseas.  We have been doing it in various ways, ad hoc. We’ve set up now an Overseas Singaporean Unit, an OSU in Prime Minister’s Office.  Wong Kan Seng is supervising this and the idea of the OSU is to engage Singaporeans overseas, keep them updated, make sure that they know what’s happening in Singapore, keep them part of our global family.  And we want to do this not just as the government taking the initiative but also to help the students or the overseas Singaporeans take the initiative, organize and link up with Singapore.  For example, yesterday there was a little conference in Singapore called Confluence 2006.  Teo Chee Hean went.  It was an initiative by a student who was in UCL, University College London.  He studied law there, he wanted to organize an event to have all the Singapore students who are overseas who happen to be back now on holiday in Singapore to gather together and to be able to have a dialogue.  They took the initiative, they organized it, 900 people showed up.  I think they had a good discussion with the ministers and I think this is something we should encourage.  In fact some of these organizers will be invited to tea.  We need to link up with them, serious events, not so serious events.

I felt Singaporean in my heart for the past 12 years”. If you go on paper qualifications, he will not qualify.  But you go on talent skill, he has something which most of us don't have.  You want people who don't have that paper but have that brain and that initiative.  Not easy to find and sometimes, they get away.  I give you one example where I wish where we got the fellow.  A Chinese illegal immigrant came to Singapore.  We found him, we kicked him out.  He changed his passport, he got back in.  When next we found him, he was running at least five hawker stalls.  He was employing at least 11 PRC Chinese.  I don't know whether legal or illegal and quite a number more of Singaporeans.  We suspect he had even bigger business but we couldn't prove but unfortunately because he was a second-time illegal immigrant, we had to throw him out again.

2006_eng.txt,29,"Singapore offers something unique. We are an Asian society with an Asian heritage and culture and roots and yet we are an open and a cosmopolitan society.  We use English as a common language, we keep our mother tongues and our cultures intact and alive and people from many cultures and backgrounds can come here, live here, be comfortable here and enjoy, integrate into our society.  Become Singapore and yet retain what is unique about them and the links which they have back to their own cultures, their own homelands, their own sense of identity.  And this is not just the three major races, Chinese or the Indians or the Malays but also manyother smaller groups. In the earlier generations, we had Parsis, we had Jews from Iraq, we had Armenians, we had Arabs – little, little groups came to Singapore and made their home here and made their contribution here.   Today, we get people from all over the world too.  We have people from Turkey, there are Portuguese, somebody from Venezuela, somebody from Morocco, even a Korean or two, some Russians.  And they add colour and diversity to this society.  So our cuisine is something special.  Singaporeans love food. You want Korean ginseng chicken, you can get the real thing cooked by a Korean.  You want Arab food, you go to Arab Street, you can eat shawarma, which is shish kebab, you can smoke the hubble-bubble, the waterpipe – now harder because new rules on no smoking – but it's something different for Singapore.  So when we get Middle Eastern visitors, they go to Arab Street, they feel very much at home. They are very happy.  And we have other customs too.  Recently, there was a splendid wedding in Singapore.  The groom came riding on a white horse. He was a Marwari, it's an Indian group, Indian businessman, very successful caste.  So the zoo is now thinking of going into the service of providing horses and elephants for weddings.  I think it's good.  But I would say this works both ways.  Because we are open and cosmopolitan, so the foreigners come here and they are comfortable here.  But we want to be open and cosmopolitan, and that is why we need the foreigners to come to add to our colour, to make this a special exciting, diverse, cosmopolitan place. Then we can remain special and become even better than the Singapore that we have been. So we encourage immigrants to keep their cultures and their languages alive, to keep the links with the countries of origin and one of the ways to do this is language.  So in schools, in education, the Ministry of Education will do more to support the study of foreign languages.   Wherever there is demand, Hindi, Arabic, Bahasa Indonesia, we will make it easy for the foreign students to learn this and in fact we will make it easy for Singaporeans who want to learn these languages as third languages because it will also help to prepare Singaporeans to link up with the opportunities outside especially I think in Southeast Asia and in the Middle East.

Need any information in the world, just Google it.  If I ask them what is an encyclopaedia, they will say “Google it”.  So attention spans have gotten shorter, when you are bored just switch.  It’s a different way of thinking, a different approach to life.  How we get to know one another, how we establish trust and links with one another has changed.  The older generation worked face to face.  Mr Lim Kim San always used to say he hates e-mail because you can’t feel the person. You call a person sit in front of you, you talk to him, you exchange views with him, you get a sense what’s going on, what he really thinks and then you can make a decision.  E-mail back and forth, you lead to misunderstanding.  But now young people they are making friends on the Internet.  They never meet one another but exchange photographs on MySpace.  What is MySpace? It’s a place where you paste your photographs and the photographs can make friends with each other. And I am told some young people even get married on the Internet.  I don’t recommend it.

You look at the polytechnics, what Republic Poly has done.  Every student has a notebook, the whole campus is Wi-Fi, wireless connected. You hand up your tutorials electronically, you do the homework on your notebook, you pass up on-line.  At 11 o’clock at night, if you haven’t passed up your homework, the site logs off, too late, you are done for.  So we are completely prepared for this and we are going to include every Singaporean in this whether you are poor or not, whether you are young or old, you will be part of this.  So we have got all sorts of schemes to help lower income families with school-going children to own PCs, to access the Internet, to be able to do their homework, their projects, same as their peers.  So nobody is left behind.   We cannot have a digital divide splitting Singaporeans those who know and have computers from those who don’t know and don’t have.  And older people are one of those groups who need extra help connecting up to computers. So we will work with them in the community centres.  We have got centres called CitizenConnect.  We have got Internet access for the old folks and for those who are not so familiar.  We have helpers to help them and to make them comfortable, we have helpers with a little bit of grey hair, so that you would understand their problem and will be able to communicate with them and get them to be comfortable.  So with the digital age, I think we are going to move ahead.  But we also must know some of the problems which the digital age will bring.  It will change the texture of our society because it will also create new problems which need to be managed.  We have more information, faster information, but at the same time, not necessarily more accurate information.  There will be half-truths and untruths which will circulate and you wouldn’t know which is which readily and there will be good views but also bad views extremist views which will divide our society.  And the terrorist groups, the Jihadigroups, they are on the Internet, recruiting, spreading their message, preparing attacks and we have to know this.  And apart from specific bad things, you also have a new phenomenon that you are in so many places on the Internet that you have to make an effort to come back and be in the same place together.  We used to say broadcasting, that means you put out a channel, TV station, or TV programme, everybody watches, broad segment of the population.  Now they say narrow casting.  I have this special interest in Frisbee or whatever itis, I aim for this group of the audience.  That group has a different interest.  He is watching a different channel. This group, the third group, another channel.  So if you have got cable TV, you may 100 channels.

In other words, the people who don’t have so much money in the CPF.   How much money do they have?  Well, if you look at the active accounts, people who are working and contributing regularly - half of the active accounts have $45,000 or less.  It’s not a huge amount, but it does include younger workers just starting to save.  So, understandably, they will have less.  If we look at just the older workers, they have a bit more, but still, if you have $45,000 you are not poor.

Combined – Ordinary, Special, Medisave, Retirement altogether – we will pay higher interest on $60,000. But not more than $20,000 of that should be in your Ordinary Account because the Ordinary Account is more liquid – you can use it for housing and so on.

You can still use your money for housing, you can still use your Medisave for medical expenses, but we will put one restriction.

But we have to react rationally to understand what is happening to us and what we can and cannot do about it.  We cannot prevent prices from rising in Singapore.  We import all our food except for a few eggs and Mah Bow Tan reminded me a few fish.  We import all our fuel and all our electricity is produced from imported either fuel oil or natural gas.  When the world prices go up, how can we keep our rice prices, our petrol prices, our diesel prices, our electricity prices down?  It cannot be done.  In terms of dollars, your wages have not gone down because most workers are earning more dollars this year than last year.  Last year was a good year, people got good increases, got good bonuses, so you have more dollars.  But when you spend those dollars, you find that they have shrunk and with inflation, what that means is some of your wage increase went to you, some of that wage increase went to the people who sell us oil.

Some governments try to do that but the subsidies cost huge sums of money. All the governments which try to do this have a very serious problem on their hands. And even those who produce oil and gas find this very hard to sustain.  You look at Malaysia, they subsidise oil but what happens?  Singaporeans go to Johor Baru to top up. Thais go across from Thailand into Kedah to top up, not your petrol tank but a huge special tank in a truck so as to get maximum benefit and they are oil producers.  They have had to cut their oil subsidies and push up prices recently.  Malaysia, Indonesia did that, also an oil producer.  China produces some oil, India also, no oil, but they were subsidising.  It is untenable.  We cannot do that but we can help Singaporeans and the way we help Singaporeans is to let the electricity price go up but to top up your SingPower accounts with U-save and give more U-Save to the poorer households, three room flats, two room flats and what that means is we are helping you directly because U-save really is cash.  We are putting it into your account, up to you to spend. If you use it for electricity, it helps you to cover your bill.  If you use less electricity it will last longer.

2008_eng.txt,15,"In fact, we have moved decisively on that.  I put together some figures to show you.  It is easiest if I show you on a graph.  But if you compare 2000 before we moved and 2008, where we are today, you will know how far we have come. In 2000, the government collected S$6 billion in vehicle-related revenues. S$6 billion, it is a huge amount of money, it is like two or three times the amount of GST we collected in that year.  Because we have changed policy by 2008, the amount has come down.  Halved – S$3 billion. So we have effectively saved Singaporeans about S$3 billion of tax and this includes everything. But to do this, we have had to push up the ERP. By how much? In 2000, that is all the ERP there was – S$80 million.  This tiny sliver at the top of the whole stick. This year, after a lot of ERP adjustments, we have doubled it.  It’s S$160 million but still very small compared to the total amount of road taxes which are collected. Despite this, we have still made this big reduction in the road taxes which we have collected, which is savings to Singaporeans.  And because of these savings, therefore, more households have been able to own cars.  In 2000, there were about 320,000 households owning cars.  Since then, in the last eight years, the number has gone up.  Now 430,000 households have owned cars, which is about one-third more, 100,000 households. I think this is something which is worth trying to do because many Singaporean households want to own cars and we have been able to enable more of them to do so.  How have we been able to do that?  By bringing down vehicle taxes and how have we been able to do that? This little red sliver here by pushing up the ERP.  This is in terms of overall growth numbers, billions.  But if you are buying an individual car, one household, one car, you can see the difference.  So I have chosen as an example of 1.6 litre car, typical Toyota Corolla, it was there in 2000, it is there this year.  In 2000, how much do you think it cost to buy a Toyota Corolla all in? S$110,000.  This year, for the same car, in fact the salesman will tell you it is a better car, the price has gone down to $64,000.  This is mainly because the government taxes have come down because the OMV has remained about the same.  It was about S$19,000 before, now it is $16,000.  So basically the Government taxes have made the cars a lot more affordable.  So the result of this is that there are more cars around us, you can see it HDB car parks getting more crowded, you can see it on the roads.  Therefore, because of this, this year we have had to increase ERP charges.

2008_eng.txt,16,"I know many people are upset by these ERP charges. But we have to see the bigger picture because in fact, the ERP charges are enabling us to benefit Singaporeans so as to reduce the burden on you and to enable more Singaporeans to own cars.  So when we had to make the adjustment this year, we considered it very carefully, how should we do this without increasing the burden on Singaporeans and we worked out an ERP package, not just raising the ERP or putting more gantries, but reducing road tax at the same time so as to offset it and overall, to bring down the costs. Let me show you how this works.  Before the package, let us take the 1.6 liter car again, probably a Toyota but could be another one.  Before the package, the ERP was $122.  After the package, it has gone up nearly $200.  So it looks very frightening but in fact, if you consider the road tax which you have to pay and which we have adjusted – you used to pay $874 of the road tax, and now it has come down to $744.  So the net effect is that you have a saving.  In fact, you’re saving money rather than out of pocket because of the ERP changes.  How much? Let us do the sums. ERP increase $76; road tax reduction $130; net savings $54.  So overall, there is a net saving from this package.  So we have not increased the burden on Singaporeans. We have actually reduced the burden on Singaporeans by some.  The trouble is people may not realise or remember how much road tax they are paying or even worse how much road tax they paid last year. Sometimes they may not be the ones paying it.  I asked one driver how much road tax she paid because she was complaining about the gantries she went through and the beeps which she heard.   So she thought for a while and then she said to me, “I am not sure, I have to ask my husband”.  Because she did not pay the bill, her husband paid the bill and I am not sure even when the husband paid the bill, he noticed that it was smaller this year. Furthermore when the husband pays the bill, there is no beep-beep but when the wife drives the car, each gantry, one beep.  So that is the problem and I think that is part of the reason why people are not happy. So we have to draw the connections and get people to understand that actually the middle-income Singaporeans have benefited from government policies.

2008_eng.txt,18,"Besides cars and public transport, we also have to pay attention to the wider needs of the public and you can get a good sense of what the public is worried about by looking at the mix of the Meet-the-People Session (MPS) cases which the MPs hold.  I do my own MPS from time to time, the MPs do regularly and I can tell you what we find.  Not many job-seekers unlike during the last recession because there are a lot of jobs to go around.  There are some hardship cases but we have a lot of schemes to help them – you have got vouchers, you have got ComCare, you have got CCC schemes, CDC programmes and so on. I talked about some just now.  But there is one worrying trend in the MPS cases and that is, there are more and more people looking for HDB rental flats.  And in one year, the number of applications has gone up, tripled and now they form the bulk of our MPS cases – the biggest group is people looking for rental flats.  Many, many reasons.  HDB is building more rental flats but if you look into the applications, not all of those who apply for rental flats are truly needy.  And HDB gave me some examples.  I show you one where a woman aged 60 was applying for rental flat and she had three children. Two of them live in private property and the children wrote down do not worry, we will jointly hire a maid to look after our mother.  Please, can she have a rental flat. I think families must have their problems otherwise they would not go and look for MPs or HDB for help but I think that for this group of people, rental flats are not the right solution.  Instead, they should look for other viable alternatives.  They can rent out a room, they can even rent out the whole flat, move in with their children. We are going to have the Lease Buyback scheme for the two-room and three-room flats which is going to be implemented next year.  Or they could sell their flat and move into a smaller flat or move into a studio apartment, also with a short lease and therefore, free up some money.  So there are various ways they can solve their problems but I think we have to manage this rental flat problem. MND and HDB will be reviewing the scheme for rental flats so that we can keep an effective safety net for the people who need this, the minority of genuinely needy families who have not only no income but also no assets and also no family support.

2008_eng.txt,19,"So I have talked about the poor, I have talked about the middle-income, I have talked about those who need housing rentals.  I think for the vast majority of Singaporeans, we have provided comprehensive measures in the budget.  Most people do not realise how much they are getting and as I said in the Chinese speech just now, if you take a three-room flat, a low-income household, say an elderly couple with one child working.  They are getting this year from the government, $5,000 all in, which is much more than any increase in their cost of living. And if you take a middle-income household, five-room, let us say middle age working parents two children, which is a typical profile, they get not a small sum either, about $3,400 and that is not counting any personal income tax rebates which they may be getting.

Which means for a three-room household like the one I mentioned earlier, they get about $500 more all in and a five-room household will get about $200 more.

They join up, they sign up and there are men in their 30s too who sign up. But the men in their 30s want to look for women in their 20s.  Why?  They make a very practical calculation. You see, I am 30 something, supposing I marry a woman who is 30 something, takes me a year to get to know her, we get married, we want to enjoy ourselves for a couple of years before we think about having babies, then we think about having babies, you add it up, I will be 40 something, my wife will be 40 something.  How?  So therefore the 30-something-year-old looks for the 20-something-year-old girl. And the 30-something year old girl has a big problem and I feel for her because I had a dialogue with some women. The women’s wing organised it for me and one such lady stood up.  She had great courage and she stood up and she spoke and she explained her problem. That she started off putting her career first. She worked, she built up her career.  After she got her career sorted out in her 30s, she started thinking about looking for a partner.  She joined, signed up dating agencies, tried, no joy.

It is a significant expense to bring up children.  First the direct child-raising expenses, the milk powder, the pram, the paediatrician, all those things cost money.  But on top of the direct cost, you also have to think about the opportunity costs for working mothers particularly and for professional mothers especially.  What do I mean by opportunity costs? When the mother is working, she is earning money. When she is looking after the child and she has to work less or less intensively, she has to forgo some income there to look after the child.  So her income has come down some so that is called opportunity cost.  Less work, sacrifice their careers.  And that is why often it is the professional women, the most successful ones who say that it is expensive to bring up children.  So paradoxically, the lower-income women feel less opportunity cost but higher income women feel it so and say so.

2009_eng.txt,1,"Friends and fellow Singaporeans, this is a significant year for Singapore. It is the 50th anniversary of our self-government. It is also the year when we have been hit by the most serious recession in half a century. Day to day we watch keenly the economic numbers - growth data, unemployment data, trade data, all the statistics. It is like monitoring the temperature chart of an H1N1 patient.
 
But we need to step back and see things in the longer perspective. Over the last five decades we have met many challenges successfully. And when we started out, we had much less than we have today.
 
Singapore achieved self-government on the 3rd of June 1959. That evening, Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his new PAP team held a huge rally on the Padang. And MM spoke. He told the crowd: ""Once in a long while in the history of a people there comes a moment of great change. And tonight is such a moment in our lives.""
 
It was quite a different mood from tonight's National Day Rally. It was a moment of great excitement. And it was also indeed the start of a long period of enormous change for Singapore. In the course of the next 50 years, we developed our economy, we created jobs for Singaporeans, we housed and educated our population, and we forged our different communities into one united people.
 
And therefore, we are quite confident that we will overcome this present economic challenge. We need to tackle the immediate situation. But we also must also look ahead to the longer term. And provided we can do both, our future is bright. How can we do this? Tonight, I will talk about four issues: the economy, healthcare, harmony in our society and shaping Singapore together. Let me start with the economy.
 
The global economic crisis has been a major challenge for us. The first hint of this was two national days ago when it was just one little black cloud on the horizon. And as we prepared the National Day messages, we inserted a warning, just to tell people, watch out, keep an eye open.
 
Last year we could see the storm approaching. So I spent some time in the rally explaining the risks. But as it turned out it was much, much worse than anybody had expected. Certainly much worse than we had expected. December, January, February, to see our GDP go down -10%, was something unimaginable.
 
Now the eye of the storm has passed. First half we did -6.5%. Less bad than we had feared although usually you would not have a minus sign down there. But now the global situation is stabilising, and including in the US, where the problems are the largest. So we are looking ahead cautiously towards the rest of the year.
 
Our labour situation has stabilised. Unemployment is not too high. Companies – some of them are hiring again, although still not in large numbers. Third quarter should be all right. Beyond that, the outlook is still not so clear. No signs of Christmas orders pouring in yet. And there are some companies which are still on short time, compulsory leave, shorter work week and so on.
 
So what has happened? Their output has gone down, their headcount has not gone down, so they are really carrying some surplus workers for the time being, helped by the SPUR programmes, with money to send them for training, and helped by the Government carrying the Jobs Credit cost for them. It is all right for the short term but it is not clear how long they can hold on to these extra workers because if the recovery is delayed, then sooner or later they will have to right-size, they will have to let go of some of these workers and there could be more job losses. So we have to be prepared. We will also see some job losses from restructuring. As companies move upstream, they will shed some old jobs. Old jobs keep on going to other countries with lower cost, maybe not quite so skilled but improving and we must be moving upstream. So as they lose their old jobs we hope they will continue to upgrade their operations here, create new and good jobs to replace the ones lost.
 
For example, Seagate is closing their hard disk drive assembly factory by the end of next year. It was in the news a couple of weeks ago. Seagate is a very big employer, and has been a very big employer in Singapore for many years. They are closing their disk drive assembly factory, losing a couple of thousand workers but they will still employ 6,000 people here, in high-value work - hard-disk media manufacturing, R&D, international headquarters operations. So instead of making the disk drive - the box, you are making the media, the material on which the recording is made, the high-tech part of the box.
 
My overall assessment of the state of the economy is that the Resilience Package which we introduced in January is working, and no need for a new prescription now. Before the end of the year, we will review and we will decide what we need to do for next year.
 
Beyond this year, I expect the global recovery to be a subdued one. It will pick up but it will not pick up in a hurry. But even in that environment, it does not mean that we cannot grow because we are small; the world markets may not be expanding fast but we can grow by sharpening our skills, and enlarging our market share. And even now we can see good signs. You can call them green shoots if you like but good signs of what is happening because local companies are doing well, we have new business areas blossoming nicely, multinationals continuing to invest good quality projects here and workers re-skilling and upgrading in Singapore.",friends and fellow singaporeans  this is a significant year for singapore  it is the 50th anniversary of our self

2009_eng.txt,2,"Let me give you some examples, just briefly. Local companies with strong capabilities are building, expanding, gaining a march on their competitors, like Hyflux. I recently met an engineer from Hyflux at a function. I asked, “How is the company doing?” He says it is doing very well, with many opportunities to build water facilities all over the world. I asked him, “Which is your most challenging project?” He thought a while, and he said, “Algeria”. They are building the world's largest seawater desalination plant in Algeria, not in a big city but at a small village next to the Mediterranean Sea, in the middle of nowhere. That is a picture of the middle of nowhere. The nearest town is three hours' drive away on a bad road. So I said, “Can you get Singaporeans to go to these places to stay?” He said, “Yes, we have 22 Singaporeans there working, including two women”. They have got spunk.
 
I said “What do they do? What happens after you finish working in a place like that? Where do you live?” He said, “Well, they live in dorms”. So these big buildings must be the dorms and as for entertainment - no alcohol because it is an Islamic country, so they play basketball and computer games. And here they are: [Online conversation]
So with the Internet, we can still talk to them. I hope they are listening over webcast to the speech tonight. Because of this and other projects, Hyflux is doing well and still hiring engineers and it shows that there is still work to be done, provided we are prepared to rough it out and take the jobs which are available, which are good jobs.
 
We are also growing entirely new activities here, like interactive and digital media, IDM. What does it mean? Games, visual effects, animation. When you go to a movie and you see fireworks or you see explosions or you see a storm or even you see a beautiful actress, it may not be real. It may be the computer graphics engineer hard at work. And it may be a Singapore engineer hard at work. The leading players have established operations here, Electronic Arts. It is the world's largest game company. They make 'The Sims'. LucasFilms is here from the US and we have got European and Japanese companies too. And the pool of local talent is growing. All our polytechnics, and NUS, NTU, NAFA, LaSalle - they are all offering courses because the demand is there. The students want to do it and the students are doing quite interesting work. Nanyang Polytechnic final year students last year did a project - a PC racing game - F1 Marina Bay. That is one scene at Supreme Court, and I think they have another scene to show you, which is at the “Durian”.
 
So we are producing game programmers, visual effects artists, computer graphics artists, all in demand. It is still young, a green shoot, but it has produced some quite impressive work. LucasFilms made one production here from concept to completion. It is called 'Clone Wars: Jedi Alliance'. This is Yoda [picture]. If you know about Star Wars, you will know who he is. I think we will produce more of such movies and this should grow into another interesting segment of our economy.
 
We are also attracting MNCs to Singapore still. They are using this downtime to think deeply about their future. They are keen to do more in Singapore, in Asia, which they see as a key growth engine for the world and they see Singapore as a base for them to do their Asia business. So EDB has been engaging these companies in strategic dialogue, to encourage them to put their high-end manufacturing, their headquarters operations, their 'control tower' functions here to service the region. Control tower like Changi Airport's control tower, tracking what is happening all over Asia, logistics, money, manpower, research or production, the whole lot. And EDB is working out with them on 5 to 10-year plans.
 
For example Rolls Royce – they make jet engines, marine engines. They moved their marine division global headquarters to Singapore this year, not just an Asian headquarters but for that part of the business - their global headquarters, controlling things all over the world - is based in Singapore. And they are also building a facility here to test and assemble Trent aero engines and a plant to manufacture the fan blades.
 
This is the engine which they are making in Singapore. It is meant for their big wide-body jets, so if you are on an Airbus 380, you may have one of these. It is taller than the man and the fan blades, these massive things, are high-tech products which they are going to make here.  We will have their first factory outside the UK to do it. And it is going to give us 500 mostly skilled jobs when fully operational, in Seletar Aviation Park.
 
So we are getting good projects, long term projects here and one key benefit and one key strength we have in attracting these projects, is the Singapore brand name. It benefits local companies when they go overseas because they say, you are from Singapore, I can depend on you. And it gives overseas companies confidence when they come here and invest here. So we should never compromise or lose this advantage.
 
It is not just a name but it depends on a united people, best workforce in the world, good leadership, first class government. When companies like Rolls Royce decide to site projects here and put a plant here, they spent years to study and decide. They are really betting on Singapore, not just for five or 10 years, but for the next 20 or 30 years. In other words, the next four, five or six elections. So take it seriously.
 
As we transform our economy workers will need to update and adapt themselves. The government is spending millions of dollars on programmes to help workers to do this, to upgrade within their jobs, and if they have lost jobs, to help them to become job-ready, to learn new skills, and to find new jobs.
 
The facilities are all there. The programmes are there. Please take advantage of these opportunities if you are out of a job, even if you are in a job. Do not wait till you are unemployed. It may mean effort, it may mean a mindset change. But we have programmes even to help people to make this mindset change, to overcome the psychological hurdles, to rebuild their self-confidence, improve their interview skills and to give one another, encouragement and moral support. I have a picture here and this is a programme, PMET career workshop, run by one of the CDCs. And I have watched the participants. It takes a while to overcome the shyness, the embarrassment, the awkwardness to let your hair down, to speak and to be prepared to take a new path. But it is worthwhile and it is productive.
 
Let me just quote you one example from Northwest CDC career centre. This was a person, Mr Mohd Amin, who was 48 years old and he was retrenched. And he went for help. And this is what he told us afterwards.
""After the retrenchment, I feared I cannot find another job because of my age...all interviews I attended were unsuccessful for three months. I was very worried as I am sole breadwinner with three schooling children. The career centre coached me to learn a skill and start a new career path. I felt supported. I attended the job placement event and I successfully found a job as an Enforcement Specialist. The training allowed me to do my job confidently. I am doing well. I am so happy now as I am earning more than before.""
 And finally the message:
""I will ask my friends to go to career centre for support and help. Tell them to be flexible and not choosy.""
That is a real message. I think it is a convincing one. We should invest in this and do more. And we will enhance the training infrastructure to support continuous training and re-training which we will need to continue to do even after the recession.
 
We have currently almost 50 training centres scattered all across the island. They are in great demand. Many of them are bursting at the seams. So we will invest more and build two national Continuing Education and Training campuses. One will be the East Campus at Paya Lebar Central. The other one is the West Campus at Jurong Lake District. They are next to MRT stations, and convenient for workers. And they will become one-stop shops for training and retraining, and job matching. And I think we will be able to get even more workers helped and trained. The Ministry of Manpower will give you more details later on.
 
Because of the way we have responded comprehensively and decisively to this downturn, we can be confident of our future. It is a deep trough, but we are coping with it. It has taken quite long. It may take some time more. But eventually the global economy will turn around, and Asia will sustain its recovery. And by then, our new strategies, our new investments, our workers' upgrading would all have taken effect. And we will be ready to pick up strongly again.
Healthcare
We are preparing for our long-term future by strengthening our social safety nets. After food and shelter, I think good health is one of the most important basic requirements which human beings have. It is more important than money. Singaporeans know that we have good doctors, good hospitals. Their worry is whether they can afford it, especially in the future after they grow old and retire.
 
We have done many things to mitigate this worry. We have a 3M (Medisave, MediShield, Medifund) system designed precisely to keep healthcare affordable to all, even and especially, the lower income group. And we have steadily improved and upgraded and extended the 3M system so Medisave now covers long term outpatient treatment, MediShield now provides higher insurance payouts, Medifund –we have increased the amounts, it is giving more help to the needy to settle their outstanding hospital bills.
 
So as a result, MPs see fewer cases of residents unable to afford healthcare, and medical social workers report that the Medifund is adequate to cover hospital bills. We will continue to improve this and to widen the 3Ms progressively but we have to do it carefully because we want to keep the system working and there are pitfalls.
 
But I know that Singaporeans are still concerned. We see medical science advancing, we see new technologies, new drugs, new procedures. People can live longer, but it costs more. And those who are in their 50s looking after aged parents, they feel the burden and they wonder “what will happen to me when my turn comes?”. They asked, “I am all right now, what about the future?” We need to gear up our healthcare systems to prepare for this ageing population and we are doing that.
 
So today I would like to explain the implications of our ageing population and how we are preparing our healthcare system to cope. What does it mean when we say our population will be older? It means there will be more demand on healthcare because older people are sick more often.
 
But this also means it is a different pattern of healthcare. Younger patients do not go to hospital so often. When they go to hospital it is an acute problem which can be treated within a few days and then they go home well. I remember I was admitted to hospital once as a teenager for an appendicitis operation and my doctor who was a wise old man said, “I am so happy to treat you because you are a young man, I treat you, you will go home well. When I treat my older patients, I see them, they get better, after a while they come back again and I have to treat them again. It is much more complicated.”
 
But now we have many more older patients who are admitted more frequently with multiple complaints. After a few days in hospital their acute condition probably has stabilised, they no longer need intensive and complex treatment but they are still not well enough to go home. You may not need to have the heart monitor, you may not need to have the blood or oxygen monitor, you may not need to have the nurse look at your every two hours or the doctor look at you twice or three times a day but you are not quite ready to go home and you still need several weeks to recuperate and to get better before you can be discharged.
 
After they go home they may still need continuing medication for underlying long-term conditions. Maybe they have diabetes, maybe they have heart disease, they may need aspirin, they may need statins. There are so many things which you have to take not just when you are sick but for the rest of your life. And even when you are at home, you may get sick again and you may have to come back again.
 
So we have to respond to this by putting in more resources into our hospital system, building new hospitals. We got the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) coming up in Yishun, we have got Jurong General Hospital coming up in the west, and that is good. Well, the buildings are easy to do, but getting the people to man them, the doctors, nurses, specialists, physiotherapists, that takes more doing but we are in the process of doing that. It needs money. We are in the process of increasing the budget too. We need to improve our 3M system. We are doing that too.
 
All these are necessary but by itself, more money is not the full solution to the problem. Because we also have to get the whole system to be structured properly so that it will be adapted to cater to the ageing population.  To structure it properly means we need step-down care. What is step-down care? I think Khaw Boon Wan has been talking about this for some time but let me explain it again because it is a vital idea and a crucial part of our solution. Step-down care means slow medicine: community hospitals, nursing homes, GPs doing more work, home care - people taking care of sick people at home. Organised properly all this can provide competent, appropriate care especially for the elderly patients. Step-down care today is provided mostly by VWOs (Voluntary Welfare Organisations). They do an excellent job but they will need government help to deal with more elderly patients.
 
And one key thing we must do with this step-down care is to link up our acute hospitals - Tan Tock Seng, and so on with community hospitals, so that you can have the best of both worlds. Patients are sick can go to the acute hospitals, where they get “fast medicine” - ICU, MRI, surgery, all the intensive intervention and high-tech medicine. Then after they get better, they go to the community hospitals – Ren Ci, St Andrew’s where there are doctors and nurses who can look after the patients and you have physiotherapy and occupational therapy and rehab but they do not need the high-end medicine. The patients go there, they receive “slow medicine”, they take some time, get well enough to go home. If in the “slow medicine” place, you need “fast medicine”, you shift back to the acute hospital, and the doctor can see to you.
 
And that way you get appropriate care, you save money and we also free up beds in the acute hospitals for more cases which need to be admitted. This is all in principle but just to understand what it really meant, I decided to go and have a look for myself. So I went to visit the new which is co-located with Tan Tock Seng. And in this picture you can see Ren Ci on the left and Tan Tock Seng in the background, on the right hand side and behind. Ren Ci has a new management and they are working with Tan Tock Seng to realise this new arrangement. Tan Tock Seng will guide the medical care of patients at Ren Ci. The two hospitals will be connected together soon with a bridge so you can just wheel the patients across, without need for an ambulance.  Ren Ci will maintain its community outreach. It has got many volunteers and these volunteers do a very valuable job helping to keep patients active and happy. And here you see (in this picture) the volunteers helping the elderly lady to get her muscles control and built up again, practising fishing for something, and cheering her up.   
     
So I think Tan Tock Seng - Ren Ci is a good model. Other acute hospitals should also tie up with community hospitals in the same way. Changi General Hospital is already partnering St Andrew’s in the east. We will build similar sister community hospitals to match in the north and to match in the west. And this arrangement will draw on the strengths of both parties - government professional teams delivering high quality care and VWOs, good at pastoral care and community outreach.
 
But the community hospitals cannot be the end of the story because you cannot stay in the hospital forever, you must go home. You want to go home. And patients are best discharged home as soon as possible so that they can be with their families, so that they can be in familiar surroundings. They will be more comfortable, happier; much better and cheaper than leaving them in the hospital. I think families want this too but at the same time, families tell us they need some help and support at home. Very often they need caregivers and maids. And the caregivers and maids may need some professional training to look after the seniors. They could require nurses to visit them more frequently, check on the patient's condition and refer back to doctors in the hospital if necessary.
 
Nowadays nurses can do many things: the nurse comes, attaches the sensors, reads an ECG, emails back to the doctor, the doctor can make a reading and then adjust the prescription or if need be, call the patient back. Home Nursing Foundation is doing good work in this respect and I think they need to ramp up, as we need more of this. GPs need to do more things with patients at home, monitoring and supervising their care.
 
So we want people at home. We would like to help you to have your patients at home and we are working on upgrading home care. It is one of Ministry of Health’s priorities. This is not sexy, glamorous medicine but this is how we can help Singaporeans look after their elderly, look after ourselves when we are elderly, look after our healthcare costs. We have to think about the whole system, provide the right treatment at the right place to patients with different needs. So I hope that doctors will give full support to this. I hope the step-down care providers and VWOs will also work together with this because they are crucial.
 
And we also need the patients' cooperation and support. Please do not insist on being in the high acute hospital, getting high-tech fast medicine. If the doctor advises you that you would be ok, go to the community hospital. It is more suitable, you get better and more appropriate treatment. We need everybody to cooperate so that we can deliver good, affordable healthcare and benefit all our patients. This is what the doctors and the hospitals can do.",let me give you some examples  just briefly  local companies with strong capabilities are building  expanding  gaining a march on their competitors  like hyflux  i recently met an engineer from hyflux at a function  i asked   how is the company doing   he says it is doing very well  with many opportunities to build water facilities all over the world  i asked him   which is your most challenging project   he thought a while  and he said   algeria   they are building the world s largest seawater desalination plant in algeria  not in a big city but at a small village next to the mediterranean sea  in the middle of nowhere  that is a picture of the middle of nowhere  the nearest town is three hours  drive away on a bad road  so i said   can you get singaporeans to go to these places to stay   he said   yes  we have singaporeans there working  including two women   they have got spunk    i said  what do they do  what happens after you finish working in a place like that  where do you live   he said   well  they live in dorms   so these big buildings must be the dorms and as for entertainment   no alcohol because it is an islamic country  so they play basketball and computer games  and here they are   online conversation  so with the internet  we can still talk to them  i hope they are listening over webcast to the speech tonight  because of this and other projects  hyflux is doing well and still hiring engineers and it shows that there is still work to be done  provided we are prepared to rough it out and take the jobs which are available  which are good jobs    we are also growing entirely new activities here  like interactive and digital media  idm  what does it mean  games  visual effects  animation  when you go to a movie and you see fireworks or you see explosions or you see a storm or even you see a beautiful actress  it may not be real  it may be the computer graphics engineer hard at work  and it may be a singapore engineer hard at work  the leading players have established operations here  electronic arts  it is the world s largest game company  they make  the sims   lucasfilms is here from the us and we have got european and japanese companies too  and the pool of local talent is growing  all our polytechnics  and nus  ntu  nafa  lasalle   they are all offering courses because the demand is there  the students want to do it and the students are doing quite interesting work  nanyang polytechnic final year students last year did a project   a pc racing game   f1 marina bay  that is one scene at supreme court  and i think they have another scene to show you  which is at the  durian     so we are producing game programmers  visual effects artists  computer graphics artists  all in demand  it is still young  a green shoot  but it has produced some quite impressive work  lucasfilms made one production here from concept to completion  it is called  clone wars  jedi alliance   this is yoda  picture   if you know about star wars  you will know who he is  i think we will produce more of such movies and this should grow into another interesting segment of our economy    we are also attracting mncs to singapore still  they are using this downtime to think deeply about their future  they are keen to do more in singapore  in asia  which they see as a key growth engine for the world and they see singapore as a base for them to do their asia business  so edb has been engaging these companies in strategic dialogue  to encourage them to put their high end manufacturing  their headquarters operations  their  control tower  functions here to service the region  control tower like changi airport s control tower  tracking what is happening all over asia  logistics  money  manpower  research or production  the whole lot  and edb is working out with them on to year plans    for example rolls royce   they make jet engines  marine engines  they moved their marine division global headquarters to singapore this year  not just an asian headquarters but for that part of the business   their global headquarters  controlling things all over the world   is based in singapore  and they are also building a facility here to test and assemble trent aero engines and a plant to manufacture the fan blades    this is the engine which they are making in singapore  it is meant for their big wide body jets  so if you are on an airbus  you may have one of these  it is taller than the man and the fan blades  these massive things  are high tech products which they are going to make here   we will have their first factory outside the uk to do it  and it is going to give us mostly skilled jobs when fully operational  in seletar aviation park    so we are getting good projects  long term projects here and one key benefit and one key strength we have in attracting these projects  is the singapore brand name  it benefits local companies when they go overseas because they say  you are from singapore  i can depend on you  and it gives overseas companies confidence when they come here and invest here  so we should never compromise or lose this advantage    it is not just a name but it depends on a united people  best workforce in the world  good leadership  first class government  when companies like rolls royce decide to site projects here and put a plant here  they spent years to study and decide  they are really betting on singapore  not just for five or years  but for the next or years  in other words  the next four  five or six elections  so take it seriously    as we transform our economy workers will need to update and adapt themselves  the government is spending millions of dollars on programmes to help workers to do this  to upgrade within their jobs  and if they have lost jobs  to help them to become job ready  to learn new skills  and to find new jobs    the facilities are all there  the programmes are there  please take advantage of these opportunities if you are out of a job  even if you are in a job  do not wait till you are unemployed  it may mean effort  it may mean a mindset change  but we have programmes even to help people to make this mindset change  to overcome the psychological hurdles  to rebuild their self confidence  improve their interview skills and to give one another  encouragement and moral support  i have a picture here and this is a programme  pmet career workshop  run by one of the cdcs  and i have watched the participants  it takes a while to overcome the shyness  the embarrassment  the awkwardness to let your hair down  to speak and to be prepared to take a new path  but it is worthwhile and it is productive    let me just quote you one example from northwest cdc career centre  this was a person  mr mohd amin  who was years old and he was retrenched  and he went for help  and this is what he told us afterwards   after the retrenchment  i feared i cannot find another job because of my age   all interviews i attended were unsuccessful for three months  i was very worried as i am sole breadwinner with three schooling children  the career centre coached me to learn a skill and start a new career path  i felt supported  i attended the job placement event and i successfully found a job as an enforcement specialist  the training allowed me to do my job confidently  i am doing well  i am so happy now as i am earning more than before    and finally the message   i will ask my friends to go to career centre for support and help  tell them to be flexible and not choosy   that is a real message  i think it is a convincing one  we should invest in this and do more  and we will enhance the training infrastructure to support continuous training and re training which we will need to continue to do even after the recession    we have currently almost training centres scattered all across the island  they are in great demand  many of them are bursting at the seams  so we will invest more and build two national continuing education and training campuses  one will be the east campus at paya lebar central  the other one is the west campus at jurong lake district  they are next to mrt stations  and convenient for workers  and they will become one stop shops for training and retraining  and job matching  and i think we will be able to get even more workers helped and trained  the ministry of manpower will give you more details later on    because of the way we have responded comprehensively and decisively to this downturn  we can be confident of our future  it is a deep trough  but we are coping with it  it has taken quite long  it may take some time more  but eventually the global economy will turn around  and asia will sustain its recovery  and by then  our new strategies  our new investments  our workers  upgrading would all have taken effect  and we will be ready to pick up strongly again  healthcare we are preparing for our long term future by strengthening our social safety nets  after food and shelter  i think good health is one of the most important basic requirements which human beings have  it is more important than money  singaporeans know that we have good doctors  good hospitals  their worry is whether they can afford it  especially in the future after they grow old and retire    we have done many things to mitigate this worry  we have a 3m  medisave  medishield  medifund  system designed precisely to keep healthcare affordable to all  even and especially  the lower income group  and we have steadily improved and upgraded and extended the 3m system so medisave now covers long term outpatient treatment  medishield now provides higher insurance payouts  medifund  we have increased the amounts  it is giving more help to the needy to settle their outstanding hospital bills    so as a result  mps see fewer cases of residents unable to afford healthcare  and medical social workers report that the medifund is adequate to cover hospital bills  we will continue to improve this and to widen the 3ms progressively but we have to do it carefully because we want to keep the system working and there are pitfalls    but i know that singaporeans are still concerned  we see medical science advancing  we see new technologies  new drugs  new procedures  people can live longer  but it costs more  and those who are in their 50s looking after aged parents  they feel the burden and they wonder  what will happen to me when my turn comes    they asked   i am all right now  what about the future   we need to gear up our healthcare systems to prepare for this ageing population and we are doing that    so today i would like to explain the implications of our ageing population and how we are preparing our healthcare system to cope  what does it mean when we say our population will be older  it means there will be more demand on healthcare because older people are sick more often    but this also means it is a different pattern of healthcare  younger patients do not go to hospital so often  when they go to hospital it is an acute problem which can be treated within a few days and then they go home well  i remember i was admitted to hospital once as a teenager for an appendicitis operation and my doctor who was a wise old man said   i am so happy to treat you because you are a young man  i treat you  you will go home well  when i treat my older patients  i see them  they get better  after a while they come back again and i have to treat them again  it is much more complicated     but now we have many more older patients who are admitted more frequently with multiple complaints  after a few days in hospital their acute condition probably has stabilised  they no longer need intensive and complex treatment but they are still not well enough to go home  you may not need to have the heart monitor  you may not need to have the blood or oxygen monitor  you may not need to have the nurse look at your every two hours or the doctor look at you twice or three times a day but you are not quite ready to go home and you still need several weeks to recuperate and to get better before you can be discharged    after they go home they may still need continuing medication for underlying long term conditions  maybe they have diabetes  maybe they have heart disease  they may need aspirin  they may need statins  there are so many things which you have to take not just when you are sick but for the rest of your life  and even when you are at home  you may get sick again and you may have to come back again    so we have to respond to this by putting in more resources into our hospital system  building new hospitals  we got the khoo teck puat hospital  ktph  coming up in yishun  we have got jurong general hospital coming up in the west  and that is good  well  the buildings are easy to do  but getting the people to man them  the doctors  nurses  specialists  physiotherapists  that takes more doing but we are in the process of doing that  it needs money  we are in the process of increasing the budget too  we need to improve our 3m system  we are doing that too    all these are necessary but by itself  more money is not the full solution to the problem  because we also have to get the whole system to be structured properly so that it will be adapted to cater to the ageing population   to structure it properly means we need step down care  what is step down care  i think khaw boon wan has been talking about this for some time but let me explain it again because it is a vital idea and a crucial part of our solution  step down care means slow medicine  community hospitals  nursing homes  gps doing more work  home care   people taking care of sick people at home  organised properly all this can provide competent  appropriate care especially for the elderly patients  step down care today is provided mostly by vwos  voluntary welfare organisations   they do an excellent job but they will need government help to deal with more elderly patients    and one key thing we must do with this step down care is to link up our acute hospitals   tan tock seng  and so on with community hospitals  so that you can have the best of both worlds  patients are sick can go to the acute hospitals  where they get  fast medicine    icu  mri  surgery  all the intensive intervention and high tech medicine  then after they get better  they go to the community hospitals   ren ci  st andrew s where there are doctors and nurses who can look after the patients and you have physiotherapy and occupational therapy and rehab but they do not need the high end medicine  the patients go there  they receive  slow medicine   they take some time  get well enough to go home  if in the  slow medicine  place  you need  fast medicine   you shift back to the acute hospital  and the doctor can see to you    and that way you get appropriate care  you save money and we also free up beds in the acute hospitals for more cases which need to be admitted  this is all in principle but just to understand what it really meant  i decided to go and have a look for myself  so i went to visit the new which is co located with tan tock seng  and in this picture you can see ren ci on the left and tan tock seng in the background  on the right hand side and behind  ren ci has a new management and they are working with tan tock seng to realise this new arrangement  tan tock seng will guide the medical care of patients at ren ci  the two hospitals will be connected together soon

2009_eng.txt,3,"But I think one important business in medicine, in healthcare is what we ourselves can do to stay healthy - by maintaining healthy lifestyles. I think you know what to do because every teacher tells children in school, and we tell you this all the time: eat more fruits and vegetables, exercise regularly, do not smoke, keep your weight down. It is easy to say but very hard to do. I was reading one doctor lamenting how difficult it is to persuade people to lose weight in where they have a big problem. And she said, “I advise my patients to lose weight. Then my patients look at me. And I said: Yes, I know but please try”.
 
So please try. It is a change in attitude. You need lifestyle changes. It requires discipline, perseverance. So lectures and speeches would not work, necessary but would not be enough. The best way is to harness social links and interests to help individuals to stick to their good habits. So we have community programmes which combine fitness with fun, with social activities, brisk walking clubs, I think Northwest CDC has got a very popular activity going. Or qigong groups, this [picture] is one group, and all races participate.           
 
One innovative scheme which encapsulates neatly what we need to do is the Wellness programme which Lim Boon Heng has been promoting and piloting in Jurong as well as a few other constituencies, with three components: Medical check-ups, regular exercise and social networking. So it becomes fun. And here [picture] you see the seniors are the ones who are dancing, not the ones who are looking. I think they are enjoying themselves. I went to visit the one in Jurong, and what really struck me was that all the seniors were cheerful and enjoying themselves, happy. So we will progressively expand this to cover the whole island. And we will reach out to more seniors so that we will help them to stay well and stay healthy.
 
Before I leave healthcare, let me just talk briefly about H1N1. That was at the beginning. It has been a big challenge for us these four months. I am very glad that Singaporeans have responded well to this unexpected virus. We were very worried when the news first broke in April of Swine Flu in . We knew it would reach us very soon but we knew very little else. How dangerous was it? How treatable was it? How badly would we be affected?        
  
So at the onset we reacted strongly. We raised our alert status to orange. We did temperature scanning at entry points, masks and gowns in hospitals and clinics, home quarantine for suspects. And many people home quarantined themselves after they came back from overseas. Very soon it became clear that H1N1 was different from SARS - more contagious, fortunately less deadly. So we stepped down, orange to yellow, but we kept up our efforts to block the virus, to delay community spread, to buy time so we would not be overwhelmed by a huge spike of cases overnight.
 
The whole of Government responded. The whole of the population responded. We had learnt our lessons from SARS. And we succeeded in delaying community spread, and slowing the impact on us. Perhaps we were lucky but I think what we did made a difference. I would like to thank everyone who was involved in this - the doctors and nurses, the hospital staff and GPs, those taking temperatures at the entry points, teachers and principals in our schools and kindergartens, health officials and so many more. You worked under a lot of stress, there must have been some worry, concern over what the dangers might have been, but you did not shirk from your responsibilities, you continued to perform under pressure. There was even one case where neurosurgery had to be carried out and the surgeon carried out the neurosurgery fully garbed up in PPE -Personal Protective Equipment: gown, N95 mask and did brain surgery. I think owes this team and all of them a debt of gratitude.
 
This is how our healthcare system should work, not just against flu but all the time and for our long-term well-being. We have a good healthcare system, universally available and affordable to all. It is the envy of many countries. The Americans spend five or six times as much as us, their outcomes are worse, the British spend maybe double or three times what we do, their outcomes also not as good, and when they analyse their systems, they tell their people: the closest model to what they want to be is what Singapore is, with the 3Ms. So we have a good system, we must improve it but do not upset it and discard it because we are doing right and good by our people. ",but i think one important business in medicine  in healthcare is what we ourselves can do to stay healthy   by maintaining healthy lifestyles  i think you know what to do because every teacher tells children in school  and we tell you this all the time  eat more fruits and vegetables  exercise regularly  do not smoke  keep your weight down  it is easy to say but very hard to do  i was reading one doctor lamenting how difficult it is to persuade people to lose weight in where they have a big problem  and she said   i advise my patients to lose weight  then my patients look at me  and i said  yes  i know but please try     so please try  it is a change in attitude  you need lifestyle changes  it requires discipline  perseverance  so lectures and speeches would not work  necessary but would not be enough  the best way is to harness social links and interests to help individuals to stick to their good habits  so we have community programmes which combine fitness with fun  with social activities  brisk walking clubs  i think northwest cdc has got a very popular activity going  or qigong groups  this  picture  is one group  and all races participate               one innovative scheme which encapsulates neatly what we need to do is the wellness programme which lim boon heng has been promoting and piloting in jurong as well as a few other constituencies  with three components  medical check ups  regular exercise and social networking  so it becomes fun  and here  picture  you see the seniors are the ones who are dancing  not the ones who are looking  i think they are enjoying themselves  i went to visit the one in jurong  and what really struck me was that all the seniors were cheerful and enjoying themselves  happy  so we will progressively expand this to cover the whole island  and we will reach out to more seniors so that we will help them to stay well and stay healthy    before i leave healthcare  let me just talk briefly about h1n1  that was at the beginning  it has been a big challenge for us these four months  i am very glad that singaporeans have responded well to this unexpected virus  we were very worried when the news first broke in april of swine flu in   we knew it would reach us very soon but we knew very little else  how dangerous was it  how treatable was it  how badly would we be affected             so at the onset we reacted strongly  we raised our alert status to orange  we did temperature scanning at entry points  masks and gowns in hospitals and clinics  home quarantine for suspects  and many people home quarantined themselves after they came back from overseas  very soon it became clear that h1n1 was different from sars   more contagious  fortunately less deadly  so we stepped down  orange to yellow  but we kept up our efforts to block the virus  to delay community spread  to buy time so we would not be overwhelmed by a huge spike of cases overnight    the whole of government responded  the whole of the population responded  we had learnt our lessons from sars  and we succeeded in delaying community spread  and slowing the impact on us  perhaps we were lucky but i think what we did made a difference  i would like to thank everyone who was involved in this   the doctors and nurses  the hospital staff and gps  those taking temperatures at the entry points  teachers and principals in our schools and kindergartens  health officials and so many more  you worked under a lot of stress  there must have been some worry  concern over what the dangers might have been  but you did not shirk from your responsibilities  you continued to perform under pressure  there was even one case where neurosurgery had to be carried out and the surgeon carried out the neurosurgery fully garbed up in ppe  personal protective equipment  gown  n95 mask and did brain surgery  i think owes this team and all of them a debt of gratitude    this is how our healthcare system should work  not just against flu but all the time and for our long term well being  we have a good healthcare system  universally available and affordable to all  it is the envy of many countries  the americans spend five or six times as much as us  their outcomes are worse  the british spend maybe double or three times what we do  their outcomes also not as good  and when they analyse their systems  they tell their people  the closest model to what they want to be is what singapore is  with the 3ms  so we have a good system  we must improve it but do not upset it and discard it because we are doing right and good by our people,"{'neg': 0.093, 'neu': 0.73, 'pos': 0.178, 'compound': 0.9978}",0.9978,Positive

Racial and Religious Harmony
Critical to our long term success other than building the social safety nets like healthcare is maintaining our social cohesion and particularly looking after our racial and religious harmony. We have discussed potential fault lines in our society quite often, between the rich and the poor, between Singaporeans and new arrivals. You see letters in the newspapers all the time.

The leaders of the groups have guided their flocks wisely. They have helped to set a wholesome and moral tone to our society.

The final requirement for us to live peacefully together is to maintain our common space that all Singaporeans share. It has to be neutral, secular. Because that is the only way all of us can feel at home in Singapore and at ease. And let me explain to you not based on arguments but specific examples to say what I mean. Sharing meals - we have different food requirements.  Muslims need halal food, Hindus don’t eat beef, Buddhist sometimes are vegetarian. So if we must serve everybody food which is halal, no beef and vegetarian, I think we will have a problem. We will never eat meals together. So there will be halal food on one side, vegetarian food for those who need it, no beef for those who do not eat beef. Let us share a meal together, acknowledging that we are not the same.  Do not discourage people from interacting.  Do not make it difficult for us to be one people.
 
Our schools are another example where we have common space, and where all races and religions interact. In government schools, but even in mission schools. Even in church schools run by religious groups, there are clear rules which MOE has set so that students of all faiths will feel comfortable.

I have gathered some - assembled from the archives, from the media who were very generous and from the Ministries and agencies.

We will start where it all began, with the Singapore River. This is [a picture of] what it looked like - lots of dirt. I am afraid I cannot bring the smell with me to show you. But my mother's office used to be near the Singapore River at Malacca Street. The street is still there. She used to have a blind telephone operator who came to work by bus every day. And the telephone operator told her that he always knew when to get off the bus because he could smell the Singapore River!
 
There were coolies on the Singapore River slogging away, carrying heavy loads, rubber, copra, rice from the tongkangs to the godowns and back, slogging for a better life for themselves, at the same time the basis of prosperity for Singapore's entrepot.      
 
Today this is all gone. The river has become transformed. The skyline has changed. No more tongkangs. We have got electric boats on the water. Boat Quay has no more coolies. You go there to enjoy yourself and have a drink, vibrantly. This [picture must be taken] early in the evening because everybody still looks sober!

Housing has completely changed. Singaporeans used to live in terrible living conditions. This [picture shows] Chinatown in the 1970s. People were desperately poor and families often squeezed into miserable little cubicles. This is not a double-decker bed. This is one cubicle below and another cubicle above, another family.        
 
Mr Lim Kim San used to tell a story of how he went to visit these cubicles because he was chairman of HDB and he wanted to understand what the conditions were like. And he met a man living in one of these cubicles in Chinatown and he was seated in a bed covered with a blanket. And he said to the man, ”Is something the matter with you? Are you sick? It's so hot, why are you covered with a blanket?” And the man says, “No, I'm not sick, I'm doing this out of respect for you because my friend and I share one pair of trousers and he has gone to work wearing the trousers.”",housing has completely changed  singaporeans used to live in terrible living conditions  this  picture shows  chinatown in the 1970s  people were desperately poor and families often squeezed into miserable little cubicles  this is not a double decker bed  this is one cubicle below and another cubicle above  another family            mr lim kim san used to tell a story of how he went to visit these cubicles because he was chairman of hdb and he wanted to understand what the conditions were like  and he met a man living in one of these cubicles in chinatown and he was seated in a bed covered with a blanket  and he said to the man   is something the matter with you  are you sick  it s so hot  why are you covered with a blanket   and the man says   no  i m not sick  i m doing this out of respect for you because my friend and i share one pair of trousers and he has gone to work wearing the trousers,"{'neg': 0.117, 'neu': 0.815, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': -0.8658}",-0.8658,Negative

We went ahead to build entire new towns and among the earliest of our new towns was Toa Payoh. Originally just market gardens, some squatters, some villages, we cleared the vegetable farms and the kampongs and we put up a modern town taking shape, high-rise living, and we moved people into the high-rise flats.   
      
And they brought with them their kampong spirit. So if you went to the flats, their doors were open, neighbours knew one another, they shared food, they chit-chatted, sometimes extended families on several floors in the same building. And here you see them friends with one another which this is good, but sometimes they also brought their kampong chickens upstairs.            
 
HDB and the MPs worked hard to improve the estates, to raise the standards of social behaviour. We are still trying but we have made progress and with continuous upgrading, Toa Payoh now has a vibrant town centre with Toa Payoh Central and with MUP, SERS, IUP and all the other initials, the new housing blocks look quite good too.

I will show you how the Bay will look soon but rather than showing you more photographs, let me take you on a sail by and fly around starting on the Singapore River.

And you fly out, the Grandstand, the floating platform, Singapore Flyer, coming out to the Marina Barrage down here. And next to that you have the Gardens by the Bay including the cool houses which will be interesting features. Trees, you see the instant trees have all arrived. And up to the top of the IRs where they have the Sky Park with a splendour view, I am getting dizzy looking at this. That is Art Science Museum and this is the Double Helix Bridge which you could have seen from the parade the other day. Along the bridge and you can take a view.
 
The IRs, you do not have to go in to gamble, you can enjoy yourself outside on the Event Plaza. They will have misters to keep you cool, fountains to amuse you, fountains there. And you go across the Bay and we will have here between the Business Financial Centre (BFC) and The Sail is a green lung with a promontory where you can have a party.

From the Singapore River to Marina Bay, we have totally transformed Singapore over the last half century. 1959 was a moment of great change but nobody at the Padang in June 1959 imagined the change to today's Singapore. It was not possible. We will continue to improve our lives, provided we work together and remain a harmonious and a cohesive society so that in another 50 years, we will have built another Singapore which is equally unimaginable today. The key is to stay united through rain or shine.
 
We just celebrated a special National Day, not just at the floating platform but all over Singapore and in many other places too. And even on the Web where 100,000 Singaporeans left birthday wishes for the nation. There were many memorable moments.
 
Take the first National Education show last month. They projected a clip of me recounting at several rallies ago how it had rained on the 1968 parade but the participants marched on and we showed the world. They were tempting fate because as soon as they finished showing that clip, it rained on them. Poured, but even the rain could not dampen their spirit and the young participants stayed through the show, braved the storm together and said the Pledge, sopping wet.
 
The show on 9th August was impressive, but what was most impressive is not just the performance but what it takes to put on such a show and what the show says about the sort of nation we are. The imagination and creativity which had to go into conceiving the show, the ability to organise, to execute, to make it happen.
 
Many national servicemen spent a lot of time packing these bags and volunteers too and organising everything so you went there, everything was exactly what it was meant to be. The commitment to excellence in all that we do and the spirit of one people celebrating our nationhood together. All this was epitomised in the Pledge moment.
 
Singaporeans from all walks of life, all over the island, and overseas too, said the Pledge together at 8.22 pm. All united, one voice, saying what it means to be a Singaporean and as one united people, we can continue to upgrade and build this city and make this place our home, our future and our Singapore.",from the singapore river to marina bay  we have totally transformed singapore over the last half century  was a moment of great change but nobody at the padang in june imagined the change to today s singapore  it was not possible  we will continue to improve our lives  provided we work together and remain a harmonious and a cohesive society so that in another years  we will have built another singapore which is equally unimaginable today  the key is to stay united through rain or shine    we just celebrated a special national day  not just at the floating platform but all over singapore and in many other places too  and even on the web where 000 singaporeans left birthday wishes for the nation  there were many memorable moments    take the first national education show last month  they projected a clip of me recounting at several rallies ago how it had rained on the parade but the participants marched on and we showed the world  they were tempting fate because as soon as they finished showing that clip  it rained on them  poured  but even the rain could not dampen their spirit and the young participants stayed through the show  braved the storm together and said the pledge  sopping wet    the show on 9th august was impressive  but what was most impressive is not just the performance but what it takes to put on such a show and what the show says about the sort of nation we are  the imagination and creativity which had to go into conceiving the show  the ability to organise  to execute  to make it happen    many national servicemen spent a lot of time packing these bags and volunteers too and organising everything so you went there  everything was exactly what it was meant to be  the commitment to excellence in all that we do and the spirit of one people celebrating our nationhood together  all this was epitomised in the pledge moment    singaporeans from all walks of life  all over the island  and overseas too  said the pledge together at 22 pm  all united  one voice  saying what it means to be a singaporean and as one united people  we can continue to upgrade and build this city and make this place our home  our future and our singapore,"{'neg': 0.008, 'neu': 0.838, 'pos': 0.154, 'compound': 0.9966}",0.9966,Positive

There you are, he has got his number, the ID is inside here and he can see his results any time. Result - save manpower.

But they are still concerned about competition for jobs, about crowding, competing for houses or for transport on MRT and deeper things, like the character of our society. And, of course, there is the psychological aspect too, the sense that they want to be valued, make sure that Singaporeans are more valued than foreigners. These concerns come through many other channels as well. We talk to the union leaders, they will reflect some of them. You read in the newspapers’ columns, the letters which are written, sometimes this shows up. When we build workers’ dormitories, we have to be very careful. We remember the sensitivities which can be aroused. Serangoon Gardens two years ago got very upset because things were not explained well enough. I understand these sentiments because these are legitimate concerns which we take seriously.

There are lots of talented young architects in Singapore. Recently, URA held an exhibition, ""20 Under 45"", and they published a little book showcasing the outstanding works by 20 young architects below 45-years-old. The majority of the architects are native Singaporeans although quite a few are foreign-born and the foreign-born ones include the two architects who built the Pinnacle, a husband and wife team. The husband, Mr Khoo Peng Beng, is from Ipoh, now a PR. The wife, Belinda Huang, is from Selangor, now a Singapore citizen. They won a design competition to build on the Duxton Plains site and the result is one of the most sought-after HDB projects in Singapore. In fact, we do not have enough Pinnacles and so many voters and residents want us to build some more. For the local architect, you might consider this foreign competition, too fierce, unfair, but for Singaporeans and especially for the residents of the Pinnacle, we benefit, we get a better living environment, we get a more beautiful city.

But now, their members are quite convinced that their companies benefit from being able to hire foreign workers and the union leaders say, yes, it is not an issue with my workers because they understand that the foreigners and the Singaporeans complement each other. And at the firm level, within each of the companies, the foreigners and the Singaporean workers work well together. They gave me this rather nice example of workers in one hotel at the housekeeping department, with employees, both locals and foreign workers. The locals are the “aunties”, the more experienced ones and the foreign workers are the younger ones. And the ""aunties"" treat the foreign workers like their own daughters or nieces.

It’s actually untrue, but that is a rumour and when she went to her new school, she was one of only a few foreigners and she was quite worried about fitting in. But then, the local students found out that she was from Hong Kong and knew about the Hong Kong film-stars and song-stars and so bonded with her because she could share information about these stars with them. When she started working in Changi General Hospital, her supervisor, who is a local Singaporean, guided her, mentored her and made a very big impact on her life because her supervisor was understanding and supportive. When her mother fell ill and eventually passed away, she had to take time-off and the supervisor accommodated her and made adjustments.

There are more than 900 volunteers who give their time and energy, who work closely with government agencies to do this Yellow Ribbon Project. One of the volunteers, Mr Philip Tan, had an idea to do this particular project.  If you read it, it says “Dining Behind Bars”.  That means for the public to go to prison, to have lunch inside the prison.  First you have to go through the bars, these are the guests arriving and the inmates will prepare the meal for you. It is not just a prison meal, it is a special meal because they are being guided by the MediaCorp’s “Chef for Hire” Ryan Hong.  Then they eat in style, this is inside the prison and the room is called the Changi Tea Room and this is the chef, Ryan Hong, who masterminded it.  You see at the back of the room, they have some pictures. Those are artworks done by the prisoners.  After the meal, they have an auction of the artworks.  The end result - raise money for the Yellow Ribbon Fund and also let the public know that our inmates are working hard to rehabilitate themselves and that they deserve a second chance.

2011_eng.txt,28,"However, there is a minority of Singaporeans who cannot afford to purchase flats, cannot afford home ownership and they will need rental flats.  We know this and we are increasing the supply of rental flats. Over the next two years, we will add 7,000 rental flats to our supply so we can cater to more families who need this help.  We are also postponing the demolition of some SERS blocks so that we can use them as temporary rental units because when you do a SERS project, you build a new block, you move the people from the old block into the new blocks and the old blocks can be demolished and redeveloped in due course. But instead of demolishing them now, we can use them as temporary rental flats until we can relieve the pressure on rentals and we can do the redevelopment a little bit later on.  And I think all these measures will ease the waiting time and make things better for households who may be very anxious to get a solution to their housing problems.  But I should say that building more rental flats is not really the most fundamental solution to the problems which these households face because their problems are really upstream.  They have run into financial difficulties or their families have split up, or there have been some gambling or some business failure, and so as a result they have cashed out on their flat which they already own and now they want a rental flat as another safety net.

Education is one of the issues which is at the top of nearly every Singaporean’s minds; a passionate concern, whether you are a student mugging for the next exam, trying to get into the next institution, next school or you are a parent, kan cheong, worrying about your kid.  The university term has just begun and this year a record number of Singaporeans are going to universities in Singapore – 12,000. One in four students of every cohort, every person that age, is going to university.  We have never had so many or so big a proportion and I congratulate all of them and their parents for doing well and for taking this significant step in their education.  But even then, not all those who applied could be admitted and not all those who got into university got their first choice of course because the competition for courses, the competition for places in some courses, is very intense.  For example, in the medical school here in NUS, we have 300 places for medical students but 2,000 students applied to do medical school, and all of them have outstanding results: three As, four As, CCA, secondment, internship, all sorts, whatever is necessary to improve their chances, they have done it.  But there is no way that we can take 2,000 so unfortunately quite a number had to be disappointed and we received many appeals from parents and students.  I got one myself whom I met in my meet-the-people session and she came to see me.  I said good evening, she said good morning.  Why? Because she had waited for me and it was about 12.30am by the time she saw me.  But it was that important to her, she made the effort.

I am not asking for financial help nor housing nor complaining about GST or cost of living.  What I am asking for is a place for my child to further his education.  Why do not you give him a chance?”  So it is a heartfelt plea which I think many parents will empathise with and which we feel too because we read all these appeals and we understand how the parents passionately want the best for their kids.

We take in 12,000 Singapore students annually now at our universities and we are going to expand the intakes further considerably.

And they will compete against us in many business areas – manufacturing, services, R&D and in some areas they will surpass us and some parts of China and India will certainly surpass us. But at the same time, these big giants will offer many opportunities for Singaporeans. Their cities: Shanghai, Beijing, Mumbai, Bangalore will become even more vibrant and exciting places to live and work. They already are, not quite so comfortable, not quite so clean environmentally but they will improve and for their people, it will be exciting. For Singaporeans, it will be very pleasant too. In the developed countries in the West, the change may not be so dramatic and their problems will also not be so easy to solve, like the problems which the Europeans are going through now.

He is a Teck Ghee resident. He works in the construction industry, he came to see me for some help because he needed to be recertified for the construction safety orientation course but he had a problem because he is illiterate. He cannot read English, he cannot read Chinese. He knows the safety rules, he can pass the exams but he needs somebody to read the exam for him, so could I please write him a letter? So I happily wrote him a letter then I had a chat with him and his wife after that and he told me proudly that his two children were graduates.

Eventually he earned a PhD from NUS, he was awarded an A*STAR international fellowship, he did a post-doc fellowship in Harvard and now he is back – research scientist, Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, I believe researching the structure of bones.

2012_eng.txt,20,"Beyond these immediate challenges, we have to look ahead, prepare ourselves for the longer term. And the most important long term investment we can make is in our people and to make it through education. It is the key response to progress in technology and to the changing world. If you ask how do I cope with UAVs, with technology, with computers, with life sciences, with new processes and products? The answer is educate yourself for the new world. Learn to control the computers and robots, do not get replaced by them. We have got to keep upgrading ourselves, out-think and outsmart the competition and be smart enough to take advantage of the technology. And we have a good education system at all levels. Our universities produce graduates which are highly sought after, here and abroad. This picture (of a university graduation ceremony) was taken I think in this room. There are more graduation ceremonies than National Day Rallies held in this room every year. Our IT and poly students do brilliantly. They are considered world class institutions; nobody else has anything like that. They compete internationally, world skills competition, they win many medals. And the latest ones, hot off the press, is the FIRA World Cup, Robo Cup, this is not the FIFA World Cup, but this the Robot equivalent. Federation of International Robotic Associations. They had their competition in Bristol and yesterday was the finals and we came back, the Nanyang Poly team, 12 medals – seven gold, three silver, two bronze. There were two classes, bigger robots and smaller robots. So the large one, Evo Rocky won the overall gold, what did they get gold for? Sprint, weightlifting, penalty kick, lift and carry, marathon. But this picture is the smaller robot, he is called, his name is Red ATOM and he is the world record sprinter, three metres forward, three meters back, the robot has to run and broke the world record of 32 seconds and BBC reported on this and described him as a ‘Usain Bolt of robots’. Our school students also do well across the board and at the top they shine also at international competitions. This year our team won the International Biology Olympiad. We hosted it and we won, the team first place, and the International Mathematics Olympiad which I think was in Buenos Aires, a Singaporean Lim Jeck from NUS Math and Science School was the top student. He came in first, with full marks, the only one to score full marks this year, first time it has happened. But we are not just focusing on the best students. Yes, we ought to celebrate our gold medalists, our outstanding ones, but our schools and teachers are also doing their best for every student, from the weakest to the most talented ones and that is why we say every school is a good school, every neighborhood you have a good school. And this is not just a slogan, this is a reality. I received an email recently from one of my residents. I use my examples because I know them but the other MPs will surely have similar ones. This was from a father Mr Balu, his son Praveen is a Primary Six student in Townsville Primary School and he wrote me this. There is Balu and Praveen. (pointing to screen) He said “I am impressed by the openness and approachability of the teachers. Together with the guidance and motivation of dedicated teachers like Mdm Suhaizan and Mr Quek, my son performed much better in his mid-year exams. With such a dedicated team of educators, we are certain that my son will be much better prepared for his forthcoming PSLE”. So every school is a good school and if you look at this picture, it tells a story because they are posing in Townsville and I have been there and these pictures are not drawn by the teachers, they are drawn by the students because it is a niche area of excellence for Townsville Primary School. I can tell you that when I was in Primary Six, I couldn’t draw pictures like that and I still cannot. But today the opportunities are there and I think the results are showing.",beyond these immediate challenges  we have to look ahead  prepare ourselves for the longer term  and the most important long term investment we can make is in our people and to make it through education  it is the key response to progress in technology and to the changing world  if you ask how do i cope with uavs  with technology  with computers  with life sciences  with new processes and products  the answer is educate yourself for the new world  learn to control the computers and robots  do not get replaced by them  we have got to keep upgrading ourselves  out think and outsmart the competition and be smart enough to take advantage of the technology  and we have a good education system at all levels  our universities produce graduates which are highly sought after  here and abroad  this picture  of a university graduation ceremony  was taken i think in this room  there are more graduation ceremonies than national day rallies held in this room every year  our it and poly students do brilliantly  they are considered world class institutions  nobody else has anything like that  they compete internationally  world skills competition  they win many medals  and the latest ones  hot off the press  is the fira world cup  robo cup  this is not the fifa world cup  but this the robot equivalent  federation of international robotic associations  they had their competition in bristol and yesterday was the finals and we came back  the nanyang poly team  medals   seven gold  three silver  two bronze  there were two classes  bigger robots and smaller robots  so the large one  evo rocky won the overall gold  what did they get gold for  sprint  weightlifting  penalty kick  lift and carry  marathon  but this picture is the smaller robot  he is called  his name is red atom and he is the world record sprinter  three metres forward  three meters back  the robot has to run and broke the world record of seconds and bbc reported on this and described him as a  usain bolt of robots   our school students also do well across the board and at the top they shine also at international competitions  this year our team won the international biology olympiad  we hosted it and we won  the team first place  and the international mathematics olympiad which i think was in buenos aires  a singaporean lim jeck from nus math and science school was the top student  he came in first  with full marks  the only one to score full marks this year  first time it has happened  but we are not just focusing on the best students  yes  we ought to celebrate our gold medalists  our outstanding ones  but our schools and teachers are also doing their best for every student  from the weakest to the most talented ones and that is why we say every school is a good school  every neighborhood you have a good school  and this is not just a slogan  this is a reality  i received an email recently from one of my residents  i use my examples because i know them but the other mps will surely have similar ones  this was from a father mr balu  his son praveen is a primary six student in townsville primary school and he wrote me this  there is balu and praveen   pointing to screen  he said  i am impressed by the openness and approachability of the teachers  together with the guidance and motivation of dedicated teachers like mdm suhaizan and mr quek  my son performed much better in his mid year exams  with such a dedicated team of educators  we are certain that my son will be much better prepared for his forthcoming psle   so every school is a good school and if you look at this picture  it tells a story because they are posing in townsville and i have been there and these pictures are not drawn by the teachers  they are drawn by the students because it is a niche area of excellence for townsville primary school  i can tell you that when i was in primary six  i couldn t draw pictures like that and i still cannot  but today the opportunities are there and i think the results are showing,"{'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.816, 'pos': 0.168, 'compound': 0.9989}",0.9989,Positive

Singaporeans have very high aspirations, every parent wants his or her son to do as well as possible, go to university, and many ITE students hope to go on to the poly and most poly students aspire to get a degree one way or another, they want to get there. So we have been increasing our university places year by year for Singaporeans but still more Singaporeans want to go. So last year, I tasked Lawrence Wong to study this issue. And he concluded that we should create more university places and that we should focus on applied practice-oriented degrees. For example engineers, physiotherapists, social workers, skills which are useful, which are in demand, which will help to get the graduates jobs. We should not just churn out graduates regardless of the quality or the employment opportunities – set up the institutions, run the courses, print the degrees, produce the graduates, generate a lot of disappointment and unhappiness. Other countries have made this mistake, you produce unemployed graduates, underemployed graduates. Europe has got them, Britain, America, even China, many graduates come out looking for work, cannot find work. So we must avoid leading people up the wrong path, misleading them that if you spend three years of your life doing this, at the end you will have a happy outcome.

2012_eng.txt,22,"Right now we have two institutions that work closely with industry and emphasize practice oriented teaching. One is SIM University called UNISIM, which is a private institution and it runs part-time courses for adult students and it collaborates closely with the industry. For example it runs aerospace systems courses and the courses include a practicum, meaning the students have to spend a certain number of hours or weeks with a company in the industry, working in the company, learning about the practical aspects of aerospace engineering and they do the same with the social workers and the other courses. The other institution is SIT, the Singapore Institute of Technology, which has high quality foreign partners in focussed areas. For example one partner is DigiPen which is one of the top American institutions for interactive digital media and here you will see the student rendering something and the younger ones among you will know that this thing is called an AT-ST, Star Wars, All Terrain Scout Transport Walker. I confess I did not know, I had to learn but the young ones know and they are going to master this. SIT is partnering the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Science and engineering courses, here they are doing robots; I think this must be a robot soccer game. They are partnering the CIA, not the Central Intelligence Agency, but the Culinary Institute of America, learn culinary arts, again one of the top institutes and if you are going to be a chef or going to be running a restaurant, the CIA teaches you how to do it well. Here the students are learning from an American chef about pita bread. So SIT works with the foreign partners and the degrees are currently awarded by these foreign partners. So what will we do? We will increase the full-time places for applied degrees. We will make SIT and UniSIM our fifth and our sixth universities. SIT will expand and it will award degrees in its own name in addition to the partnerships it has. UniSIM will add full-time programmes to its part-time courses and it will build on its strong industry links but it will remain a private university. And that way we can increase the current full time university intake by a total of 3,000 students a year by 2020. In other words, today we take in 13,000 undergraduates a year, first year, by 2020 we will take in 16,000 students a year, 3,000 more and that would mean 40 per cent of each cohort will go to university, up from 27 per cent today and that would include more poly students and more JC students and I think that it will help to meet the aspirations of many Singaporeans.",right now we have two institutions that work closely with industry and emphasize practice oriented teaching  one is sim university called unisim  which is a private institution and it runs part time courses for adult students and it collaborates closely with the industry  for example it runs aerospace systems courses and the courses include a practicum  meaning the students have to spend a certain number of hours or weeks with a company in the industry  working in the company  learning about the practical aspects of aerospace engineering and they do the same with the social workers and the other courses  the other institution is sit  the singapore institute of technology  which has high quality foreign partners in focussed areas  for example one partner is digipen which is one of the top american institutions for interactive digital media and here you will see the student rendering something and the younger ones among you will know that this thing is called an at st  star wars  all terrain scout transport walker  i confess i did not know  i had to learn but the young ones know and they are going to master this  sit is partnering the technical university of munich  tum   science and engineering courses  here they are doing robots  i think this must be a robot soccer game  they are partnering the cia  not the central intelligence agency  but the culinary institute of america  learn culinary arts  again one of the top institutes and if you are going to be a chef or going to be running a restaurant  the cia teaches you how to do it well  here the students are learning from an american chef about pita bread  so sit works with the foreign partners and the degrees are currently awarded by these foreign partners  so what will we do  we will increase the full time places for applied degrees  we will make sit and unisim our fifth and our sixth universities  sit will expand and it will award degrees in its own name in addition to the partnerships it has  unisim will add full time programmes to its part time courses and it will build on its strong industry links but it will remain a private university  and that way we can increase the current full time university intake by a total of 000 students a year by  in other words  today we take in 000 undergraduates a year  first year  by we will take in 000 students a year  000 more and that would mean per cent of each cohort will go to university  up from per cent today and that would include more poly students and more jc students and i think that it will help to meet the aspirations of many singaporeans,"{'neg': 0.022, 'neu': 0.906, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.9677}",0.9677,Positive
2012_eng.txt,23,"That is for full time but at the same time, I think we should not forget the part time students, the adult students. UniSIM runs part time courses, I visited them recently, I was impressed with them, with their students too. Most of their students are in their late 20s or 30s, mostly poly graduates, gone out to work and decided to resume their studies while working. I chatted with some of them and I asked them why did you want to do this, take this path? They said well, when they left school or poly, they were not certain what they wanted to do, so they started work. After a few years of work, they knew the job market better, they knew themselves better, they had decided what they wanted to do with their lives, they resolved to enrol in UniSIM and start up again. Married with children, with jobs, but they have decided to do it and they were going to make it succeed. So I found them mature, clear in their own minds, what they wanted to do in their lives, determined to succeed, quite a different profile from young students who go straight to university and for whom all possibilities are still open. So it needs tremendous commitment and grit to succeed if you go to UniSIM and I think we should help people like that. Sometimes both husband and wife attend the course at the same time and I met one couple Alfred Toh and Natalie Chen who are both on course at the same time. Alfred Toh and Natalie Chen, Alfred is doing marketing, Natalie is doing visual comms. Midway through the course, Natalie got pregnant, so the course had to pause, the baby was born but when the baby was a little bit older, Alfred and Natalie resumed their course and now the baby is a toddler Zhi Xuan and Alfred and Natalie are about to graduate. So I think they deserve our congratulations. So this is a very good option for some segment of our students to leave school, go to work and then later on when you are clearer what you want to do, do something which is focused, practical and will help take your life aims forward. So we should give them more support. How? We will make more part time places available and secondly we will extend government bursaries and loans to UniSIM part-time students, so that they get the same support as part time students in NUS and NTU.",that is for full time but at the same time  i think we should not forget the part time students  the adult students  unisim runs part time courses  i visited them recently  i was impressed with them  with their students too  most of their students are in their late 20s or 30s  mostly poly graduates  gone out to work and decided to resume their studies while working  i chatted with some of them and i asked them why did you want to do this  take this path  they said well  when they left school or poly  they were not certain what they wanted to do  so they started work  after a few years of work  they knew the job market better  they knew themselves better  they had decided what they wanted to do with their lives  they resolved to enrol in unisim and start up again  married with children  with jobs  but they have decided to do it and they were going to make it succeed  so i found them mature  clear in their own minds  what they wanted to do in their lives  determined to succeed  quite a different profile from young students who go straight to university and for whom all possibilities are still open  so it needs tremendous commitment and grit to succeed if you go to unisim and i think we should help people like that  sometimes both husband and wife attend the course at the same time and i met one couple alfred toh and natalie chen who are both on course at the same time  alfred toh and natalie chen  alfred is doing marketing  natalie is doing visual comms  midway through the course  natalie got pregnant  so the course had to pause  the baby was born but when the baby was a little bit older  alfred and natalie resumed their course and now the baby is a toddler zhi xuan and alfred and natalie are about to graduate  so i think they deserve our congratulations  so this is a very good option for some segment of our students to leave school  go to work and then later on when you are clearer what you want to do  do something which is focused  practical and will help take your life aims forward  so we should give them more support  how  we will make more part time places available and secondly we will extend government bursaries and loans to unisim part time students  so that they get the same support as part time students in nus and ntu,"{'neg': 0.008, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.179, 'compound': 0.9977}",0.9977,Positive

2012_eng.txt,25,"At the other end of the education system, we also need to improve the quality of our preschool education. Once upon a time, education used to start when you went to school and entered Primary One or Standard One. My mother’s generation it was like that, about 90 years ago now, she only learnt to read when she went to school and it wasn’t because she was disadvantaged or deprived, it was the norm; that was how kids learnt. And she never felt any loss and she managed perfectly well in life. But when it came to my turn, she sent me at a young age to Nanyang kindergarten to learn Mandarin and that was 50 plus years ago, times had changed by then and times have changed even more now. Family structures have evolved, there are more nuclear families, just husband and wife and fewer children. More dual-income parents – so fewer opportunities for the kids to socialize at home with grandparents, with elder siblings, with cousins. We now know how important the early years are for children’s development. The brain is most receptive to learning certain things at that age especially languages, sounds, grammar, pronunciation. It is an age where kids can gain confidence and curiosity about the world around them – What is that? Let’s go and explore, let’s take a small risk, learn what is dangerous and what is not. It is also when kids should pick up positive behaviour, social skills and learning attitudes – when to queue up, take your turn, share. And so good preschool education will prepare students to enter Primary One and it will provide many long-term benefits later on in life whether in terms of your career stability, in terms of not getting into trouble with drugs, or with crime, in terms of your family’s stability when you get married. So today in Singapore, nearly 99 per cent, nearly all children, in fact more than 99 per cent of kids already attend preschool. There is a diverse mix of operators. Two key anchor operators, we call them AOPs, one is NTUC, the other one is PAP Community Foundation. They are the anchor operators, they have just under half of the total market and many different private providers as well. The government provides financial support to make preschool affordable. And we also provide support to the anchor operators to raise their standards. We have been doing this for several years, we are making progress but I think it is not enough and we have to do more. I think we have to substantially raise the quality of preschool education for children aged 5 and 6 years old especially the AOPs, the mass market anchor operators and at the same time we have to keep preschool affordable especially to the middle and lower income households because if you are going to raise standards considerably, it is going to mean more resources, higher costs, you are going to recruit more teachers, even better quality teachers, it is going to cost money and if you are going to do that, without raising the cost to their parents, and keeping it affordable, the government has to come in. Our objective is to level up all our students and make a positive difference to their development especially the students from the disadvantaged homes. So the government will invest substantial resources in preschool education and play a more active role.",at the other end of the education system  we also need to improve the quality of our preschool education  once upon a time  education used to start when you went to school and entered primary one or standard one  my mother s generation it was like that  about years ago now  she only learnt to read when she went to school and it wasn t because she was disadvantaged or deprived  it was the norm  that was how kids learnt  and she never felt any loss and she managed perfectly well in life  but when it came to my turn  she sent me at a young age to nanyang kindergarten to learn mandarin and that was plus years ago  times had changed by then and times have changed even more now  family structures have evolved  there are more nuclear families  just husband and wife and fewer children  more dual income parents   so fewer opportunities for the kids to socialize at home with grandparents  with elder siblings  with cousins  we now know how important the early years are for children s development  the brain is most receptive to learning certain things at that age especially languages  sounds  grammar  pronunciation  it is an age where kids can gain confidence and curiosity about the world around them   what is that  let s go and explore  let s take a small risk  learn what is dangerous and what is not  it is also when kids should pick up positive behaviour  social skills and learning attitudes   when to queue up  take your turn  share  and so good preschool education will prepare students to enter primary one and it will provide many long term benefits later on in life whether in terms of your career stability  in terms of not getting into trouble with drugs  or with crime  in terms of your family s stability when you get married  so today in singapore  nearly per cent  nearly all children  in fact more than per cent of kids already attend preschool  there is a diverse mix of operators  two key anchor operators  we call them aops  one is ntuc  the other one is pap community foundation  they are the anchor operators  they have just under half of the total market and many different private providers as well  the government provides financial support to make preschool affordable  and we also provide support to the anchor operators to raise their standards  we have been doing this for several years  we are making progress but i think it is not enough and we have to do more  i think we have to substantially raise the quality of preschool education for children aged and years old especially the aops  the mass market anchor operators and at the same time we have to keep preschool affordable especially to the middle and lower income households because if you are going to raise standards considerably  it is going to mean more resources  higher costs  you are going to recruit more teachers  even better quality teachers  it is going to cost money and if you are going to do that  without raising the cost to their parents  and keeping it affordable  the government has to come in  our objective is to level up all our students and make a positive difference to their development especially the students from the disadvantaged homes  so the government will invest substantial resources in preschool education and play a more active role,"{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.123, 'compound': 0.995}",0.995,Positive

2012_eng.txt,29,"Education is vital to the future of Singapore, to creating hope for a better tomorrow and hope is essential to our future and to the Singapore story. But besides hope, Singapore tomorrow must also have a bigger heart. Care and compassion for the needy and elderly, but also a largeness of spirit, a generosity, magnanimity to those who are around us. It reflects the sort of people we are and the values which we hold dear. We have for a long time recognized the importance of taking care of the less fortunate members of society. We have worked hard to build an inclusive society and enabled everyone to enjoy the fruits of progress, especially the weak and the elderly and the disabled, through housing, through education, through healthcare – heavily subsidized and widely available. But especially and more fundamentally through growth, prosperity which has created jobs and improved lives for all. Over the last decades, new needs have emerged. Society has become stretched out, somewhat stratified, we get pressure of globalization, so we have addressed these new social needs with new programs, Workfare, Comcare, additional housing grants, special housing grants, so many schemes, so many ways to help but the objective is targeted to uplift Singaporeans who need help. In this year’s Budget we made a major shift with an Inclusive Budget with significant initiatives for the elderly like the Silver Housing Bonus, for the low and middle income like the GST vouchers, for the disabled like daycare activity centres. We are not just spending more but we are setting a new strategic direction for Singapore and laying the basis for stronger social safety nets which will stand the test of the next couple of decades because we are striking a new balance in our social compact, what you must do as individuals, as families and what the state will help you to do so that we can advance together. What we have started in the budget we will build on in the years to come. But I would like as always to have a caution, have a care, three cautions. 
First, inclusiveness does not just mean more good things from the state or falling from heaven. All benefits have to be paid for. People say you are rich, you have reserves. We are already relying on reserves, spending part of the returns from investing these reserves. It is what Ministry of Finance calls NIRC, Net Investment Returns Contributions. It is an item in the budget. When you invest the money every year it grows, you take a bit of that growth or half of that growth and we use it for our spending. It has helped us fund many new programs and still balance our budget without having to push up taxes sharply. Last year FY 2011, from the reserves we got $8 billion to spend. We got more money from the reserves to spend than we got by collecting personal income taxes and I think it is four times as much as we got from COEs. It is not a small amount of money. It is one seventh of our expenditure every year, comes from our reserves. We are already drawing on this. If the reserves grow, you may get more.

Residents reserving public roads outside their houses to park their own cars. They do not use tissue paper, they use dust bins, they use flower pots and then they use dust bins and flower pots to fight one another once in a while. HDB neighbours on the same corridor quarrelling over the washing of the corridor. One wants it clean, the other wants it dry, no end of arguments. Placing of potted plants, arguments over noise – one says he is practising his singing, the other one say you are disturbing my child’s examination preparations. It becomes a feud. The RCs have a big headache because they are friends with both but they cannot make the problem go away. People objecting to nursing homes and studio apartments in their own place but please put it just across the road so it is not too far away. These are not new things, it is still only a minority but we seem to be getting less patient, less tolerant, less willing to compromise in order to get along. Maybe it is because we are losing the kampong spirit. We talked about the kampong spirit, we think back to the picture just now which I showed in my Chinese speech of how the kampong was. All the kids big and small gathered around the well. You are not just collecting water or washing clothes or bathing but you are interacting with one another and therefore getting along with one another. When we moved into HDB flats, some of that remained, you had the common corridors, people leave the doors open, talked to one another. There are common spaces. You may wait for the lift and in the old days you wait quite long for the lift because one lift on three floors, no LUP yet. One way or another you interact with your neighbours and you become friends and so there is give and take. But today we lead more private lives. The corridors, many of them are not common corridors, three, four flats share one lift landing. LUP, now you do not have to go downstairs and meet and people from three levels, just people on your floor. Work takes more time. There are fewer opportunities to bump into neighbours. Unconsciously less interaction results in less consideration, maybe more self-centred behavior and maybe that explains why there is a rising trend of not so good behavior. But we should not less this spread and make us into ugly Singaporeans. I think we will be ashamed of ourselves. We should do our best to be big hearted, to our neighbours to our fellow citizens, in fact to our fellow human beings. It is not just a matter of courtesy. It goes much deeper than that.

2012_eng.txt,36,"There is one particularly difficult area where we need to be big hearted and that is in relations between Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans. I think most Singaporeans understand the need for immigrants for foreign workers and accept them but many Singaporeans have concerns because the influx has caused some real problems and I completely understand this and I think it is fair enough for people to express concern or to disagree with our immigration trends or oppose our immigration policy. That is part of the democratic debate. But I am worried by some of the nasty views which are expressed, especially online and especially anonymously, which brings out the worst in people. When the foreigners say or do something wrong, especially to Singaporeans, the response is overwhelming. But when a Singaporean does something wrong, which I think we all have to admit once in a while does happen, very often the behaviour is un-criticised. And when a foreigner does a good deed, very often that goes unnoticed. I give you some examples from the Internet. Sun Xu became famous, NUS student, made an angry blog post, offensive, he was roundly and rightly chastised and punished by NUS. But if you go online, you will find many nasty posts by Singaporeans about foreigners. In fact, there are some websites which specialise in tormenting and berating certain groups of foreigners from certain countries. Very few people stand up to say that this is wrong, this is shameful, we repudiate that. I think that’s no good. You look at incidents on buses. The Straits Times published one letter recently about foreigners on a bus, the foreigners who made a difference because a woman, an old woman got sick on the bus, threw up, dirty, smelly, the other passengers all shied away. This foreign nurse came forward, cleaned her up, helped her, took her off the bus, was the only one who responded. So somebody wrote this in the forum page. There was no video, there was no Youtube (video), there was no Internet response whatsoever. On the other hand, when two women quarrelled over a bus seat, you know which Youtube video I am talking about. The non-Singaporean behaved and screamed outrageously, the Singaporean sat there, her video went viral. So I think this as the Taiwanese author says 独眼龙 “one-eyed dragon”. We cannot afford to be one-eyed dragons. It reflects badly on us, it damages our international reputation. People think that Singapore is anti-foreigner, xenophobic. New York Times carried an article, very powerful headline “In Singapore, Vitriol Against Chinese Newcomers”. Other newspapers carry stories too. Herald Tribune carried the same story, softer headline. Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, even Xinhua carried stories. It does not do us good. But more fundamentally than that, apart from our reputation, it speaks poorly of what sort of people we are. I mean, what sort of people do we want to be? We need to be people who are proud of ourselves, who have a heart, who can feel for other fellow human beings, who will be courteous, respectful and behave with others as we would like others to behave to us. It is not my job to give a lecture or a sermon, this is a speech. But I have to point this out, this is my duty. There will social frictions from time to time, it is unavoidable. There will be non-Singaporeans who will behave badly. They may post something offensive, they may behave badly towards neighbours, they may offend people of other races because they are insensitive. They do not know what the norms are and ditto, from time to time, there will be Singaporeans who do that too. And unfortunately, technology is one of the things which has made this worse because with smart phones and social media, it is easier to give offence and it is easier to take offence. You cannot pretend you did not see and even if you think nobody saw, somebody may have filmed it. So we should deal with these incidents maturely. It is all right to express disapproval of what has happened, it is necessary even. It is not alright to be a one-eyed dragon or to condemn all non-Singaporeans or all Singaporeans based on the actions of a few bad apples. Also, it is wrong to slam the shortcomings of others but ignore our own transgressions. So we have to work on this from both sides. Singaporeans have to show a generosity of spirit to one another, including to the new arrivals. And the new arrivals also have to make the effort to embrace our values, to commit themselves to Singapore and to integrate into our community. We will welcome into our midst, into our family but you must make the effort too. There are success stories in integration. Many immigrants from the PRCs serve in the grassroots or do charity work. Many Indian PRs volunteer as youth mentors in SINDA, help little kids to read, to have other activities outside school which are meaningful. I was told of one German PR married to a Singaporean who shops at Tekka Market, makes his own sambal and loves durians so I think he qualifies as an honorary Singaporean. But one story in particular caught my eye and it is of a Vietnamese girl called Le Ha Thanh Mai who is here today. She came to Singapore when she was 15 years old, did not speak English, on a scholarship, she went to school, she had difficulty adjusting because of language but also because school was taught differently here and in Vietnam. But she went on to Temasek JC, things improved. Her classmates welcomed her, helped her to integrate. By the time she went to SMU, she was so localised that if you did not know her name, you would not know she came from somewhere else. So her fellow students elected to become the international student secretary of the SMU Students Association and her job was to lead efforts to encourage other international students to integrate with the locals and to learn more about one another’s cultures. So here she is, this is not quite our culture but nevertheless here is Le Ha Thanh Mai in the middle jumping highest of all. So I read you what she wrote in reflection of her experience here. “I feel as much as a Singaporeans as I am a Vietnamese. I have come to love the hawker food, the Singapore River that I jogged along, the fireworks every National Day on the magnificent background of Singapore skyline, the shopping malls a few streets down the road, the cinemas where I spent many nights watching movies, the schools I attend and most importantly, the friendships I have made”.

A home we love, which is the theme for this year’s NDP. Families are a big part of what home means because families are central to our sense of who we are. You are not the job you do but you are a papa or mama or daughter or granddaughter or cousin, these are the links which are the closest. Families give us the reason to defend and protect what we have and when we say set up home, we mean settle down, have kids, bring up a family. And therefore, Singapore has to be a home where people want to get married, want to have children, want to bring up the next generation. But alas, we are having too few babies. I will show you the TFR chart. This is replacement level, 2.1 total fertility rate which means every woman produces 2.1 kids, replaces herself, her husband and a little bit to spare. But if you look at actually what we have been able to do from 1975 onwards, we started off there, around 2.1 but the trend has been steadily down ever since, coming down to about 1.2 last year and all the way down. There are ups and downs from year to year, the red years are 12 years apart, ’76, ’88, ’00 and ’12, but I cannot imagine the ‘12 being here (pointing to a TFR higher than in 2000) and therefore, we have a problem. The long term trend is down but we cannot give up, we have got to do something about it. And when people ask me, which many visitors do, what problems do you have in Singapore, I offer them this one as an example of one not easy to solve and they give me their ideas, sometimes serious, sometimes not. One Asian politician said why do you not have more blackouts? He has blackouts, he has high TFRs, does not mean I have blackouts, I will have high TFR. It is not so simple. More Singaporeans remain single or they are getting married later. Part of the reason is working too long hours and I am saying this quite seriously, I think being connected 24/7 is marvelous but having email round the clock is not an entirely good thing. Married couples are having fewer children, on average now each married woman has two kids. Previously it was more, so this number has also been coming down. So they are replacing mom and dad but they are not making up for those who are not marrying and having children and 20-30 plus per cent now are not marrying, not having children. So we have a problem.",besides hope and heart  singapore must always be our best home  a place where we feel that we belong  where we show our loyalty to our country  where we take pride in what we have achieved together and what we stand for  a home we love  which is the theme for this year s ndp  families are a big part of what home means because families are central to our sense of who we are  you are not the job you do but you are a papa or mama or daughter or granddaughter or cousin  these are the links which are the closest  families give us the reason to defend and protect what we have and when we say set up home  we mean settle down  have kids  bring up a family  and therefore  singapore has to be a home where people want to get married  want to have children  want to bring up the next generation  but alas  we are having too few babies  i will show you the tfr chart  this is replacement level  1 total fertility rate which means every woman produces 1 kids  replaces herself  her husband and a little bit to spare  but if you look at actually what we have been able to do from onwards  we started off there  around 1 but the trend has been steadily down ever since  coming down to about 2 last year and all the way down  there are ups and downs from year to year  the red years are years apart       and   but i cannot imagine the  being here  pointing to a tfr higher than in  and therefore  we have a problem  the long term trend is down but we cannot give up  we have got to do something about it  and when people ask me  which many visitors do  what problems do you have in singapore  i offer them this one as an example of one not easy to solve and they give me their ideas  sometimes serious  sometimes not  one asian politician said why do you not have more blackouts  he has blackouts  he has high tfrs  does not mean i have blackouts  i will have high tfr  it is not so simple  more singaporeans remain single or they are getting married later  part of the reason is working too long hours and i am saying this quite seriously  i think being connected 7 is marvelous but having email round the clock is not an entirely good thing  married couples are having fewer children  on average now each married woman has two kids  previously it was more  so this number has also been coming down  so they are replacing mom and dad but they are not making up for those who are not marrying and having children and 30 plus per cent now are not marrying  not having children  so we have a problem,"{'neg': 0.053, 'neu': 0.893, 'pos': 0.055, 'compound': -0.2244}",-0.2244,Negative
2012_eng.txt,40,"Many Singaporeans have explained their considerations and their concerns, when to get married, when to have kids. And I have talked to some of them, recently I talked to one young lady, a teacher, she has four kids, young ones from the age 14 to the age of one, and she has gone back to work as a teacher and she appreciates the schemes we have for working mothers, paid maternity leave, flexi-work arrangements and so on but she says but if I took all these schemes, then I am pushing my load onto my colleagues, other teachers and furthermore when it comes to assessment time, my head of department and my principal will not know what grade to give me. So even if you are giving me more of these leaves and perks, it will not help me with my career which was important to her. So I asked her what is the one thing that would encourage Singaporeans to have children and she said “work-life balance” but then she added “but that is not in your power to give”. She understands. We want work-life balance, we encourage people to have work-life balance, but finally it is the attitudes of the employers, it is the attitudes of the individuals who are pursuing their careers, it is a social norm, everybody is working, so I feel I have to work long hours too and so we are stuck in that position. I talked to another young couple. They are volunteers in my branch and when I have MPS, the husband is there till past midnight. They are newly married, moved into a HDB flat in Sengkang, not ready for children yet, even though the flat has already arrived. So I asked them what are your considerations? I want to understand how you see these choices before you. What would help? The husband said you should make childcare more accessible, you should offer more flexible work arrangements. The wife had a slightly different take, also very sensible, and she said I don’t want six months maternity leave, my boss might forget about me, but if you can have paternity leave and fathers can help to bring up the children, that would be helpful.

2012_eng.txt,43,"Housing – in other countries, you get married, you have kids, and then eventually you save up, you buy a house. In Singapore, it is the other way round. House first, then you think about marriage, then you think about kids. I think now that housing is off the boil and we have built more flats, many more flats in the pipeline, I think that we should give some consideration to giving couples with young kids priority when they book HDB flats. Firstly it will solve their problem faster, secondly it may encourage them to have a kid so that the flat will come faster. Thirdly, at birth, this question of leave, I think maternity leave at 16 weeks is about all right, you can make it longer but employers have serious worries and we should take them seriously and I think employees have worries too but this idea of paternity leave in some form, either you give some to the husband or you make some of the maternity leave convertible, we have said no for a very long time, but I think it is time we change. To signal the importance of the father’s role and your shared responsibility for raising the children, so please use the paternity leave for the purpose it is given. Fourthly, medical, one of the worries which couples have when they bring up a kid is what if something is wrong and the medical expenses, how are we going to meet that? So one idea is we create a Medisave account for each kid when it is born, when he or she is born and we put a small hongbao in for him to start life and you can defray the childhood medical expenses and reassure the parents, no need to worry and that part is seen to. Another thing we can do is preschool which I have talked earlier about the steps we are going to do to raise standards, to make it affordable, to put a lot more resources in, I think that would be helpful but other than preschool, there is also childcare and infant care and we should give more financial support to low and middle income households for childcare and infant care. And as for the places where these are going to go, we need some in the housing estates near homes, I think we need some near workplaces, and we should help the operators who set up the centers in the housing estates or near the workplaces and I hope that if one comes to a block of flats near you, you will welcome it even if you have no longer young children.",housing   in other countries  you get married  you have kids  and then eventually you save up  you buy a house  in singapore  it is the other way round  house first  then you think about marriage  then you think about kids  i think now that housing is off the boil and we have built more flats  many more flats in the pipeline  i think that we should give some consideration to giving couples with young kids priority when they book hdb flats  firstly it will solve their problem faster  secondly it may encourage them to have a kid so that the flat will come faster  thirdly  at birth  this question of leave  i think maternity leave at weeks is about all right  you can make it longer but employers have serious worries and we should take them seriously and i think employees have worries too but this idea of paternity leave in some form  either you give some to the husband or you make some of the maternity leave convertible  we have said no for a very long time  but i think it is time we change  to signal the importance of the father s role and your shared responsibility for raising the children  so please use the paternity leave for the purpose it is given  fourthly  medical  one of the worries which couples have when they bring up a kid is what if something is wrong and the medical expenses  how are we going to meet that  so one idea is we create a medisave account for each kid when it is born  when he or she is born and we put a small hongbao in for him to start life and you can defray the childhood medical expenses and reassure the parents  no need to worry and that part is seen to  another thing we can do is preschool which i have talked earlier about the steps we are going to do to raise standards  to make it affordable  to put a lot more resources in  i think that would be helpful but other than preschool  there is also childcare and infant care and we should give more financial support to low and middle income households for childcare and infant care  and as for the places where these are going to go  we need some in the housing estates near homes  i think we need some near workplaces  and we should help the operators who set up the centers in the housing estates or near the workplaces and i hope that if one comes to a block of flats near you  you will welcome it even if you have no longer young children,"{'neg': 0.093, 'neu': 0.802, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.8923}",0.8923,Positive

2012_eng.txt,45,"Besides families, memories of places of old friends, of events we have lived through are also essential to keeping Singapore our best home. It is often the simple things in life which remind us most of home. I was reminded of this recently when I got another email from the public, a young lady called Thecla Loh who wrote to me to wish me Happy National Day and she shared with me something she had written which I liked and I would like to share with you too. I quote a little bit of what she wrote. She said “it is the simple things which I love about my country like waking up on a Saturday morning, feeling the chill in the morning air, deciding to go downstairs to have a warm bowl of duck porridge instead of the usual cold cereal, having freshly fried piping hot you zha gui with ice cold soya milk on a whim” – my mouth is watering already – “having an elderly lady in a wheelchair pull up beside me mistaking me for one of her kopi kakis and discussing the weather with me in Hokkien, watching the Indonesian maid speak fluent Hokkien to her elderly wheelchair bound employer and showing genuine concern and care for the old lady, reminding me of my grandmother and her Indonesian helper whom I am truly grateful for for helping to take care of the needs of my grandmother in her last years.” So it is the family, an extended family and even the Indonesian maid is part of this extended family. Thecla remembers Singapore by the food, the people, most importantly by the family and so too with all of us and with me. Home, the house where you grow up, the family you grew up with, the times when you were young and this picture which I discovered recently and had not seen before taken in May 1965 has all of that, 38 Oxley Road, parents, siblings and also the dog. But over the years, more links formed, more memories accumulate. To me home means other things as well, memories of places, places you have known over the years for many years which have changed and when you see it, it is playing a video replayed. You scroll back in your mind’s eye and you imagine it as it used to be. Nanyang Primary School, today handsome new buildings, young generation of excited students. When I went to kindergarten this is what it looked like and this is what I still imagine it to be. Here is the old school hall, the 礼堂 (school hall) and our kindergarten was inside there, no computers, no complicated play equipment, just one class in each corner cordoned off and one piano. That was then. I drive down Orchard Road, swank shopping places, strange new buildings. This is Orchard Central. I think back to the old Orchard Road car park. The younger generation may not know but once upon a time this was where the best hawker food in town was to be found. The “ou luak” (oyster omelette) has never been better! You go down Bras Bash Road. Today SMU, beautiful gracious buildings, trees, students there maybe with boyfriends and girlfriends studying, reflecting pools, modern Singapore, but I think back when I was a student, the SJI school field. I was not from SJI but Catholic High next door had no school field so we borrowed this one. Sports Day, band marching, practising this is where we went.

I brought the Rally to ITE for a serious purpose – to underscore my longstanding commitment to investing in every person, every Singaporean, to his full potential. And also to signal a change, to emphasise that this is not the usual NDR. Singapore is at a turning point. Tonight, I will talk about the challenges which we face and what we must do to change to respond to these challenges in this new phase of our development and nation-building.
Last year, I spoke about these essential elements of our future, “Hope, Heart and Home”. Since then, we have been holding Our Singapore Conversation (OSC) on building a better Singapore. The OSC took a fresh approach to engage Singaporeans. They had no pre-set agenda, it was a fully open discussion and it elicited a very positive response. Nearly 50,000 people participated, and diverse groups. We had elderly residents meeting at the Yuhua Hawker Centre. Grace Fu brought them in and they had the discussion in dialects.

(Pointing to slides) This is a printer behind, this is the monitor and you can see the thing which it is printing. It looks like a little rectangle with two holes in it. Those are the Bone Tissue Scaffolds. What do you use it for?

Less spectacular but equally far-reaching are robots, Artificial Intelligence, programmes which can do smart things which previously only human beings could do. Not just placing chips on the production line but skilled, professional jobs - accounting, legal advice, radiology, reading X-rays. In the old days, each one was a professional job.

2013_eng.txt,15,"In the last two years we have moved decisively to do more to help Singaporeans to own their homes. We have built a record number of new flats, cleared the first-timer backlog. We have delinked new flat prices from the resale market and stabilised BTO prices. We have introduced a Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG), targeted for poorer households to buy two-room flats, three-room flats. We have raised the income ceilings and relieved the sandwiched class. And we have allowed singles to buy BTO flats, something which they have asked for, for a very long time. And we introduced the NS Recognition Award – NSRA – for NS men. It is a hongbao paid into the CPF accounts of the NSmen, which NSmen can use to buy a flat, some of it. So all of these things have made flats more affordable and more accessible.
 
But I know that Singaporeans still worry about property prices. We do surveys and it is one of the items on their minds, (along) with healthcare. They ask themselves - if they are young - can I afford a flat when I get married? If you are older - can my children afford to get married? Because no flat cannot get married, or as they say in Singapore, ‘cannot ROM’. They ask, what if I lose my job before I finish paying off my flat, paying off my housing loan? And so in the OSC conversations, Singaporeans wanted “Home First, Then Asset”. Ideally of course, you want the home, you want the asset, you want it all. One lady, a mother at a dialogue expressed this. She said she hoped her property would appreciate because it is hers and she wanted to keep its value, but then at the same time she wanted her kids to have cheaper housing. And then she laughed because she knew that you cannot really have both. You must decide which it is going to be. So we cannot deliver everything this mother is hoping for but we can maintain the value of HDB flats over the years, provided Singapore remains stable and strong.

If you are earning $4,000, you should be able to afford a 4-room flat and that is completely possible. When I say afford, I mean use your CPF mostly and have a 25-year loan, not a 30-year loan and then in your later years, your income can be used to beef up your retirement savings. So $1K, 2-room flat; $2K, 3-room flat; $4K, 4-room flat; 25-year loan, mostly from your CPF. It can be done, we are almost there. How do we do this? I do not think we want to do this by bringing down the BTO prices because that after a while will bring down all the resale market and everybody who owns a flat in Singapore will be hurt. But we will keep the BTO prices stable for some time; we will increase the support for the lower and middle-income households. And we already have the mechanisms to do this, to subsidise flat purchases. I talked about the Special CPF Housing Grant just now, SHG.

We are happy they are able to buy the 2-room flats; it is a reasonable cost on them every month. But what we should do is to help them when they are ready to upgrade from a 2-room to a 3-room flat when they improve their lives, and we will give them some Step-Up Housing Grants to help them to upgrade later on. So from 2-room if you need to upgrade later, you get help from the Government. For others buying 3-room and 4-room flats, the lower income, the lower-middle income, first-time buyers, 3-room and 4-room flats, we can also do more. The 3-room flats relatively speaking are less of an issue, it is more affordable. The 4-room flats, it is okay but I think we can give more help to the households who are buying them.

And we will also broaden it so that instead of only for the low income households, we will also allow it for the middle-income households.

2013_eng.txt,18,"HDB has a very beautiful development - Fernvale Riverwalk, a BTO project in Sengkang. It is a marvellous place, waterfront living, 2-room, 3-room, 4-room flats, Sengkang West Avenue, Fernvale Link, Punggol Reservoir just down there. There are going to be four residential blocks, 20- to 22 storey-high with spaces for relaxation and bonding. So there will be children’s playgrounds, if you are young kids; there will be adults and elderly fitness stations, you can practise for your IPPT; resting shelters, a precinct pavilion, open green spaces and if you like nature, not very far away, leisure stroll along the boardwalk next to Punggol Reservoir. Hence it is called Fernvale Riverwalk. Furthermore, supermarkets, eating house, shops and a childcare centre. Everything is there. How much do you think a 3-room flat in this place will cost, cheapest? People say flats are expensive. How much do you think they will cost? Think about it. BTO price, I think I should do a poll. I offer you three choices - $150,000, $200,000, $250,000. Who thinks that the cheapest flat is $250,000? Hands up. Who thinks the cheapest flat is $200,000? Hands up. Wow, quite a lot.

I think $200,000 wins, but actually $200,000 loses, because the cheapest flat is just $150,000. 3-room flats, posted price. So if you add grants, add subsidies, low income families pay even less.

He is being helped through the CHAS scheme (Community Health Assist Scheme). He has a blue card. Every time he visits his doctor, he gets a subsidy up to $80, it helps pay for the consultation, helps pay for his medications. It is a big saving for him. He has a blue card, his wife has a blue card, his father, his sister, they all have their cards. But he has two teenage children, 15 and 17, and they do not have CHAS cards. Why? Because for CHAS, when we made the scheme, we set a lower limit, you have to be 40 years old before you can join the scheme to get it started. Now that the scheme is well launched, we have 300,000 people on CHAS, the system is working nicely, I think we remove this floor and younger Singaporeans will also be able to join the CHAS scheme, including Mr Tay’s two children.

They brought up this generation and they paved the way for us to live a better life than themselves. That was their goal. They achieved it and I think we should know that and we should be grateful to them. Now mostly they are retired, at least in their late 60s, many older. And we must take special care of this pioneer generation in their golden years. We have recognised them and given them something extra. Every time we have had a bonus exercise, a scheme, Minister for Finance, each time we designed a scheme, we distribute something for the senior citizens, the pioneer generation, something extra. Whether it is home care subsidies, whether it is GST vouchers, whether it is a Resilience Package, we make sure that they are treated different. And I think in these new healthcare arrangements, we will likewise make sure that they are well taken care of. So, we will have a special Pioneer Generation Package to help pay for their premiums for this group under MediShield Life, to make sure that our pioneer generation will be well-covered and would not need to worry about healthcare in their old age.

The Government subsidies are going up and will go up some more. But some part of it has to be paid by ourselves and each of us must save enough to pay for our share. Therefore, I think you can guess what my next line will be - Medisave rates have to go up. It has to be. We will increase these contribution rates over time as and when our economic conditions permit. How, how much, we will have to discuss carefully. But the direction is quite clear, we need to save more and that will stand us in good stead because one day we will all grow old, if we are lucky. But the best way for us generally to keep healthcare costs down is to stay healthy and especially for older people because for older people exercise is not just keeping fit or keeping well but also making friends, having the social contacts, the networks, the mutual support.",one group which we need to take special care of is our pioneer generation  they are special  they are the ones who worked hard to build today s singapore  the generation to independence  60s  70s  80s  they made this place  they enabled us today to enjoy these facilities  they earned less than us  they had fewer safety nets when they were working  they brought up this generation and they paved the way for us to live a better life than themselves  that was their goal  they achieved it and i think we should know that and we should be grateful to them  now mostly they are retired  at least in their late 60s  many older  and we must take special care of this pioneer generation in their golden years  we have recognised them and given them something extra  every time we have had a bonus exercise  a scheme  minister for finance  each time we designed a scheme  we distribute something for the senior citizens  the pioneer generation  something extra  whether it is home care subsidies  whether it is gst vouchers  whether it is a resilience package  we make sure that they are treated different  and i think in these new healthcare arrangements  we will likewise make sure that they are well taken care of  so  we will have a special pioneer generation package to help pay for their premiums for this group under medishield life  to make sure that our pioneer generation will be well covered and would not need to worry about healthcare in their old age  i think we owe it to them    what i have talked about on healthcare so far is what the government is doing  but there is always that aspect which the individual must do  we each have to take personal responsibility for ourselves  both financing and also just looking after our health  we are going to spend more on healthcare year by year  the government subsidies are going up and will go up some more  but some part of it has to be paid by ourselves and each of us must save enough to pay for our share  therefore  i think you can guess what my next line will be   medisave rates have to go up  it has to be  we will increase these contribution rates over time as and when our economic conditions permit  how  how much  we will have to discuss carefully  but the direction is quite clear  we need to save more and that will stand us in good stead because one day we will all grow old  if we are lucky  but the best way for us generally to keep healthcare costs down is to stay healthy and especially for older people because for older people exercise is not just keeping fit or keeping well but also making friends  having the social contacts  the networks  the mutual support,"{'neg': 0.013, 'neu': 0.825, 'pos': 0.163, 'compound': 0.9969}",0.9969,Positive

Whichever school you go to, whichever class or principal you have, you will get a good education. And we give every school the teachers, the resources, the backing. We help many of our schools develop niches of excellence. We make sure that the whole system is of a high standard. Every school is a good school. But parents and students have a different perspective. They accept the MOE argument but they still have strong preferences for certain schools. And even within the same housing estate, two separate schools, few hundred metres apart, parents will go to great lengths to bring their children into School A instead of School B. I see it every year when it comes to school admission time after the PSLE exams, when people come and try very, very hard. Having got a place in a good school, they want a place in another school which in their view will be better for their kid. Sometimes they succeed, sometimes they do not. But the belief is very deep. And nationally that happens too, because secondary schools admit students from across the country and based on their academic results. So, the results of parents looking for what they think are the best schools and consulting websites like kiasuparents.com -- I am past that point, but I have not reached kiasugrandparents.com yet -- but the result of that is certain top secondary schools get a very high concentration of the very good students or at least the students with very good results.

And it gives priority to siblings, to children of alumni, to the school community - for a reason. Because we want each school to develop its traditions, its history, and its identity. We want the school to have a community which cares for it. We want the school to be proud of itself, to have to know where it has come from and to feel that.

One says, give absolute priority to those who are living nearby, which is fine if you happen to be living nearby the school you want to go to, or if you can afford to buy a house nearby the school you want to go to, but it is not such an ideal system if you take it from a system point of view.

The PSLE is one of our most important examinations or at least, many parents think that the PSLE is one of our most important examinations. Because it is not just a report of the student’s performance in primary school, but parents think that this determines the student’s future. I just had an email from somebody who wrote to me to say, please be very careful when you touch the PSLE, because the problem is not the exam. The problem is that parents think that the exams count for everything in the world. If you go to this stream, you are fixed for life; you go to that stream, you are fixed for life; if you go there, well, you are set for life. So that is the problem. So I replied to him, I said no, I do not agree that that (i.e. the stream determining one’s path for life) is the how our education system works but I shall be very careful. He replied to me again, he says, I do not agree that is how the education works either but that is how parents think and therefore, we have to be cognisant of that and we have to take that into account and I think we must do that. But whatever it is, because of all this, because of the way the parents think, there is a tremendous stress when it comes to the PSLE exam. The whole family takes the examination! I knew that people went on leave for PSLE but I watched a snippet on Mediacorp recently, and this mother said she actually stopped work for the whole year to take the PSLE with her daughter! What do we do? I asked, what did the OSC people say? One group went into this, came back and reported, we discussed this at length, we do not like the existing system at all, we looked at all sorts of alternatives, we could not agree on an alternative which was a better way to post the students to secondary schools. So the recommendation finally - please do not change the PSLE system. But I think we should make some careful changes to the PSLE system.",the second small thing we are going to do is something about the psle  the scoring system  the psle is one of our most important examinations or at least  many parents think that the psle is one of our most important examinations  because it is not just a report of the student s performance in primary school  but parents think that this determines the student s future  i just had an email from somebody who wrote to me to say  please be very careful when you touch the psle  because the problem is not the exam  the problem is that parents think that the exams count for everything in the world  if you go to this stream  you are fixed for life  you go to that stream  you are fixed for life  if you go there  well  you are set for life  so that is the problem  so i replied to him  i said no  i do not agree that that  i e  the stream determining one s path for life  is the how our education system works but i shall be very careful  he replied to me again  he says  i do not agree that is how the education works either but that is how parents think and therefore  we have to be cognisant of that and we have to take that into account and i think we must do that  but whatever it is  because of all this  because of the way the parents think  there is a tremendous stress when it comes to the psle exam  the whole family takes the examination  i knew that people went on leave for psle but i watched a snippet on mediacorp recently  and this mother said she actually stopped work for the whole year to take the psle with her daughter  what do we do  i asked  what did the osc people say  one group went into this  came back and reported  we discussed this at length  we do not like the existing system at all  we looked at all sorts of alternatives  we could not agree on an alternative which was a better way to post the students to secondary schools  so the recommendation finally   please do not change the psle system  but i think we should make some careful changes to the psle system,"{'neg': 0.079, 'neu': 0.865, 'pos': 0.056, 'compound': -0.8735}",-0.8735,Negative

Wah, 230, not bad, can get into this school or not? And what about him, did you hear that one went to 180? Wah, do not know what happened”. It happens, so I do not think it is a good thing.

2013_eng.txt,45,"So we will score PSLE differently. We will use wider bands for grades, ‘O’ levels are like that, ‘A’ levels are like that. ‘O’ levels, you have A1 all the way down to 9 which is a fail. ‘A’ levels, I am not sure how exactly, but you also have A, B, C, D, E but I think if we have a system of grades like that rather than precise scores, it will reduce the excessive competition to chase that last point. If you get an A* that is an A*, it does not matter where it is 91 A* or 99 A*. It is an A* and that is good enough. You do not have to chase that last point. Then you will be able to sit back and you have space to educate and develop the students more holistically. But what I am talking about is what we are intending to do. It will take us some time, several years. So if you are taking the PSLE in a few months’ time or if your son or your grandson is taking PSLE in a few months’ time, please do not panic. We are not going to do anything this year. It is going to take several years to do.
 
Next, let me say something about having more flexibility in secondary schools. We want secondary schools to have the flexibility to tailor the education of their students to their abilities and the development of their students. Some develop faster than others, some have interest in certain subjects more than others, some are good at all subjects, a few are weak at many subjects. We have to have a system which can fit each of these cases and we will adapt it to that person. Already we have some flexibility between points, between PSLE to ‘N’ levels, or ‘O’ levels to ‘A’ levels. You can cross over; you are not fixed in one stream or one course. And we have students who have made this and transferred. For example, I have two young people here who have made this. I have Lim Chi Siang, who is here with us this evening. He went from EM3; he went to Normal (Academic) stream in Si Ling Secondary School. He went on to Yishun JC and after JC, he has made it to NUS to study Physics. He is now doing NS but after NS, NUS is there, the place is available to him. So the system has given him the chance, the time to develop, make sure he learns properly, next stage take a bit longer, five years rather than four in ‘N’ levels, then JC he made good, now he is going to university. Or another example, Ahmad Muhammad bin Rosman, who had a difficult family background. He went from EM3 to Normal (Tech). Many people do not prefer Normal (Tech). From Normal (Tech) he went to ITE. ITE did a good job with him. He did well, he skipped the Higher NITEC course, he has entered Singapore Poly and he is doing a Diploma in Visual Effects and Motion Graphics. So one day, he will help me make graphics for my presentation.",so we will score psle differently  we will use wider bands for grades   o  levels are like that   a  levels are like that   o  levels  you have a1 all the way down to which is a fail   a  levels  i am not sure how exactly  but you also have a  b  c  d  e but i think if we have a system of grades like that rather than precise scores  it will reduce the excessive competition to chase that last point  if you get an a  that is an a   it does not matter where it is a  or a   it is an a  and that is good enough  you do not have to chase that last point  then you will be able to sit back and you have space to educate and develop the students more holistically  but what i am talking about is what we are intending to do  it will take us some time  several years  so if you are taking the psle in a few months  time or if your son or your grandson is taking psle in a few months  time  please do not panic  we are not going to do anything this year  it is going to take several years to do    next  let me say something about having more flexibility in secondary schools  we want secondary schools to have the flexibility to tailor the education of their students to their abilities and the development of their students  some develop faster than others  some have interest in certain subjects more than others  some are good at all subjects  a few are weak at many subjects  we have to have a system which can fit each of these cases and we will adapt it to that person  already we have some flexibility between points  between psle to  n  levels  or  o  levels to  a  levels  you can cross over  you are not fixed in one stream or one course  and we have students who have made this and transferred  for example  i have two young people here who have made this  i have lim chi siang  who is here with us this evening  he went from em3  he went to normal  academic  stream in si ling secondary school  he went on to yishun jc and after jc  he has made it to nus to study physics  he is now doing ns but after ns  nus is there  the place is available to him  so the system has given him the chance  the time to develop  make sure he learns properly  next stage take a bit longer  five years rather than four in  n  levels  then jc he made good  now he is going to university  or another example  ahmad muhammad bin rosman  who had a difficult family background  he went from em3 to normal  tech   many people do not prefer normal  tech   from normal  tech  he went to ite  ite did a good job with him  he did well  he skipped the higher nitec course  he has entered singapore poly and he is doing a diploma in visual effects and motion graphics  so one day  he will help me make graphics for my presentation,"{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.86, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.9934}",0.9934,Positive

2013_eng.txt,47,"Finally, let me say something about the top schools. This is a somewhat awkward subject. We want every school to be a good school. Why are there top schools in Singapore? I think there are top schools in Singapore; it is good that we have these outstanding schools in our system with very high standards. It is a tribute to the teachers, the students and also to our education system. Many of these schools have long history and traditions, some even longer than Singapore’s. Over time, they have produced many leaders – leaders in the private sector, leaders in the social services and leaders in the government. They have produced not just successful people but pillars of our society. Not the only way to do so but a significant number of people have done so. Therefore, it is all the more critical that these schools should develop their students holistically and admit their students holistically and imbue the right ethos and values to them, expose them to diverse backgrounds, to build empathy and understanding and make sure the students stay rooted in the society which has nurtured them and invested hopes in them. Most importantly, we need to keep the admissions to the top schools open, so they do not also become closed circles. Not closed because you have to have certain parents, but closed because you have to have perfect grades. So I think that you should take not just students with outstanding academic results, but also very good students with other special qualities - qualities of character, of resilience, of drive, leadership - people who can show that they can make a difference in the world. And the top schools also must make sure that students from low-income backgrounds are not put off from applying to enter for fear that they cannot afford it, or that they cannot fit in because sometimes you can afford it, but if you do not feel comfortable because you feel like your friends are talking about things which you cannot afford, you feel out of place and I think that is bad and should not happen.

Now if you are outstanding in arts, in sports, even in academics, you can come in on the DSA. But we must broaden this to also take into account character, resilience, drive, leadership. We have got to get the top schools to actively seek out such students, look for them. Some of them have scholarships for these schemes. We have got to get and invite primary schools to suggest possible students to the schools or suggest to the students that they take an interest (in their secondary school postings), explore it.

2013_eng.txt,49,"So these changes to our education system will help to keep our pathways upwards open to all and make meritocracy work better for Singapore. Meritocracy has to remain the most fundamental organising principle in our society. We have to recognise people for their contributions and their effort, not for their backgrounds, not for their status or wealth or connections. This cannot be a society which is based on guan xi (connections). It must be based on your ability, your contributions, what are you giving back to the society. So at the same time, if you succeed under our system, then you must feel the duty to contribute back because you did not do it alone. Therefore, if that works, we invest in you, you give back, then everyone will benefit from the system and will see it as fair and good. ESM Goh recently went down to RI for an alumni dinner and he described this as building a “compassionate meritocracy” and I think he was exactly on the point. One good example of this in action is Dr Yeo Sze Ling. She is here with us this evening. I met her and I thought I should tell you about her. Dr Yeo Sze Ling became blind at the age of four. She studied at the Singapore School for the Visually Handicapped. She did not go to a brand name school. She went to Bedok South Secondary School, Serangoon JC. She had an interest in Mathematics, she was good at it, she read Mathematics in NUS and she graduated with three degrees, including a PhD in Math. I stare at a page of Math with the formulas; I do not understand what is going on sometimes. But to be able to imagine it, visualise it, manipulate it, express it, that is amazing. She topped the Faculty of Science in her year, now she is a research scientist at A*STAR and an Adjunct Assistant Professor at NTU. (Pointing to slide) And here you see her, she is operating a Braille typewriter with headphones and so the headphones read back presumably the mathematical formula which she is typing in. But she is not just a successful professional, she is volunteering at the Society for the Physically Disabled, helping others to overcome their disabilities, which is why she richly deserved to win the Singapore Youth Award last year where I met her. Well done, Sze Ling! Sze Ling proves that you can do well if you work hard.

Can you imagine? One runway in Paya Lebar, already aeroplanes coming in and going out over so many houses. (What more) two runways in Paya Lebar? But Mr Lee said no, study, study, study again.

So, I said, “well, let us say you live in this house for another 30 years, then you really do not need the rest of the lease beyond that. You only need these 30 years. So, this part, you can sell to HDB and HDB will buy back from you. That is why it is called the lease buyback.

He is not your money lender. This is for retirement. We provide this flexibility but members must understand clearly the trade-offs because if you take out the lump sum, that means you will have less left in the CPF and your monthly payments will also be less.

Passionate, enthusiastic, they take great pride in their gardens. They beautify their neighbourhoods, they spruce up their environment, they have spice gardens downstairs, fruit gardens, flower beds and they submit outstanding entries to the Singapore Garden Festival.

The Government has heard them, we have adjusted our policies, upgraded our infrastructure, slowed down the inflow of foreign workers, tightened up on PR and citizenships applications, made sure that Singaporeans are fairly treated at work.

Companies would not have enough workers. Some will close down and our own people working in these companies will lose their jobs. Also we need foreign workers to build our homes and schools, to meet our daily needs, we need foreign domestic help. So we cannot close our doors completely. On the other hand, if we let in too many foreign workers, our society will come undone. Singaporeans will be crowded out, workplaces will feel foreign, our identity will be diluted and we just cannot digest huge numbers. Therefore, we have got to find something in-between, make a right trade-off but even in-between there is a cost and there is a price and there is a pain.

Last year, he attended the UN Climate Change Conference which was held in Peru, in Lima in December. Vivian led the Singapore delegation but he did not just represent Singapore. He was appointed one of two Friends of the Chair. The other Friend of the Chair was Norway. And the role of the Friend of the Chair is to be an honest broker. To work behind the scenes to bridge the gaps between the different countries, to help put together a deal that countries could agree upon. So it is an important low-key job. They chose Vivian and Vivian was effective. Why? Because he was competent and mastered a very complicated brief. Every time he briefs Cabinet, we have to spend time reading the paper understanding the subject all over again and asking Vivian what does all these mean? But it his job to know and to explain and to analyse how we can protect our interests and not be disadvantaged. But he also was supported by a strong and cohesive team of Singapore officials. Different ministries, each knowing their job but able to work together across the ministries and take a national perspective. So they could staff him, they could work out alternatives, they could propose compromises, they could tweak the language, they can go and chat up different groups and find out what different groups are thinking. That was Team Singapore at work. They actually should wear red T-shirts at such meetings. Vivian and Team Singapore helped the Lima conference to reach a successful outcome. They had to overrun. I think they went for another 36 hours but in the end there was a positive agreement and in the process, the agreement also protected and advanced Singapore’s interests. That’s one example.
 
I give you another example. These are all far away from defence. So people understand that even apart from armed forces, we have to be on our guard and know how to work with others to advance our interest. This next example is Lim Swee Say.

This year he went in June, the Director-General of ILO hosted the conference dinner, so dinner is meant to talk shop. And at dinner many of the Labour Ministers shared the problems they faced in their countries, all facing similar problems – slow job, growth youth unemployment, stagnating wages, widening income gaps. It was a very miserable dinner. So Swee Say is never one for a miserable dinner, he decided to turn the discussion around and to focus on solutions and not problems and he did it, the way only Swee Say knows how to do it.  He started by acknowledging we all face the same 3 “D” challenges, D for delta. What’s D? Jobs Deficit, Skills Deficit, Quality Deficit, so three D’s.  So everybody nodded, say yes. Then he said, we all want the same three F’s opportunities – future. Jobs of the future, skills of the future, career of the future, everybody smiled. Then he concluded that the solution was to strengthen the three P’s – Partnership between the partners. Partners: Government, unions and employers. And he shared about Singapore’s unique tripartite approach and sold a little bit of “koyok” for us. So when Swee Say had finished, the mood in the room had lifted and everyone was discussing solutions and not moping. And the Director-General rounded the discussion and proposed three cheers for Singapore.

We have a complicated system of HDB grants. If you are buying a house, you know the details but the gist of it is, there are weighted towards those who earn less. So the less you earn, the more generous our grants. The more you earn, you may still be eligible for an HDB flat but I think you can pay for a bit more of it yourself. So we will enhance our grants which help the lower and middle-income households buy flats. The way we do that is we have the Special CPF Housing Grant which is called the SHG – Special CPF Housing Grant. We will extend the SHG to cover more households. Right now, the SHG has an income ceiling, which is $6,500, and that is half of all households. And we will raise this ceiling to $8,500 so that two thirds of households will qualify for the SHG.

And we have got a scheme to do this which we’ll call it the Fresh Start Housing Scheme. What will a Fresh Start Housing Scheme do? It will help second-timer rental households own a two-room flat. The flat will have a shorter lease, the flat will have stricter resale conditions that can make it more affordable and also may maximise the chances of people holding on to it and not just flipping it.

It’s also supporting the family with counsellors, to guide them to solve their problems holistically, all aspects – jobs, school, drugs, family relationships, planning for the future, saving for the future. The family has to play its part, and show that they are putting their lives in order, determined to get back on their feet, committed to putting their children through school. Then if they show that and with all these extra arrangements, I think we can justify providing a grant for them – a Fresh Start Housing Grant – to help them pay their flat. So it is not without conditions. You have to do your part. But you do your part, we help you, you have a second chance.

I will speak about two groups tonight - the seniors, and families and babies. Let me start with the seniors. The elderly will always have a place in Singapore. We honour them because they brought us here, they brought us up, and they will always have something to contribute to Singapore. That is why we made the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) to express our gratitude to the pioneers who contributed so much to building today’s Singapore. Having made the package, we made an extra effort: we sent PG Ambassadors to every home, to visit pioneers at home, chat with them, understand their needs and explain to them how they can personally benefit from the PGP. And in the process of talking to them, we learnt many heart-warming stories and we collected them in a nice book which we launched last month. It’s titled, “Their Past: A Present for Our Future”. Quite a clever title; lots of interesting stories in the book. One in particular is about two friends - Mr Mutu Sammy, and Mr Ching Chong Kwi. Mr Mutu Sammy is 69 years old, Mr Ching is 81 years old. They have been neighbours and close friends for ten years. Mutu lost his leg long ago in a traffic accident. Mr Ching, who is 81 years old, takes care of Mutu - looks after his plants, changes light bulbs for him, drives him to medical check-ups. Mr Ching speaks Mandarin, Mutu speaks English, and they talk to each other in Malay. That’s the Kampong spirit for you. Mutu and Mr Ching told our Ambassadors that they are very happy with the PG Package and the PG Card because Mutu benefits directly from it. There is a PG Disability Assistance Scheme and he qualifies and he gets $100 a month, and when he visits the Specialist Outpatient Clinic, the net amount he has to pay is just $12.

2015_eng.txt,47,"Now, let me talk about families and babies. We discuss these as policies - what should we do, rules, incentives - but at the root of this is not policy. It is people, families and their children. Our families are what make life meaningful for many of us and our children are what will ensure that Singapore will have a future. In fact, our children are the reason why we want Singapore to have a future, for them, and so we decided on a baby Jubilee Gift for SG50 babies. And you can see some of the things down here – A box, the strap, some T-shirts, and some other diaper holders. I am glad to hear from Grace Fu that we have given out almost 20,000 SG50 packets this year, including one to Tin Pei Ling. When I go around and see parents with the red sling, I will ask them “Ah, SG50 baby. Congratulations! How many months old?” And then, “When is the next one coming?” In fact, I have been trying to find a family which has two Jubilee babies. It is possible. And finally I came across one. Introducing Charlotte on the left and Colette, on the right, twins born three weeks ago. I hope couples continue to have many babies after SG50, but I know it is a serious decision. It is hard work and a lifelong commitment. You sacrifice your time, your sleep, you have to buy milk powder, diapers, and parenting goes on for many years, well after your children have supposedly grown up. Having a child is a major responsibility, but we will help you, because every Singapore child is precious to us because each one is a member of our Singapore family. So when I speak about families at the National Day Rally, I always try to do something to make it easier for parents to have babies. Not just practical help, but also signals to change mindsets and attitudes and, therefore, encourage people gradually to change behaviour. For example, making workplaces more family friendly or getting fathers to do their share of parental duties. If you look at the numbers, last year’s numbers seem promising. This is the graph of the babies born every year since 2000. 2000 was a bumper year. 41,600 Dragon Year. The next Dragon Year there is a bit of a blip, but what encourages me is that this year 2014, not a Dragon Year, but almost as big as a dragon. If you look back, it is almost 10 years since we have had that many babies in one year. So it is not bad and I expect that this year, we will have about the same number as 2014. On National Day this year, we had a record number of babies born – 129, 9th August babies.
 
These are statistics, but what I see directly when I go around confirms this. Because nowadays I often see families who have lots of kids and they are proud and happy that they have many children and they tell me that they have many children. On the Jubilee weekend, I met the Goh family at new Ci Yuan Hawker Centre. I went to see the hawker food, but I got a bonus I saw some babies as well. I started off noticing this SG50 baby, then I counted the sister one, brother one, another brother one two, three, four, five kids in one Goh family. Father was not there. I said where’s the father? Father queuing up for food.  So talked to the father, he works in the SAF, mother is a homemaker and they are enjoying family life.  It is good!  So I think this is a good time to give our families and babies efforts an extra push. We will push in four ways.

They have talked to us, they have made useful recommendations on how to level the playing field.

On the other side, we also talked to the new operators and the new operators tell us, it is not so easy to compete in Singapore because unlike other cities, in Singapore, the taxi business is quite efficient. It is competitive, the drivers work hard and so, they have to work hard to get their share of the pie. So there is competition. The playing field is in play. Not quite level. Taxis still have some extra rules. They have to drive a minimum mileage every day. I know this is a sore point. There are other statutory requirements which make taxis more expensive to operate.

In the logistics business, there are two major problems. One, delays in customs clearance because when you go from border to border, somebody wants to look inside your box. And secondly, theft. That means pilferage or maybe the whole container disappears. So Ascent Solutions came up with a digital solution. They were backed by SPRING and they developed a tracking device and a lock called iSpot. The iSpot is a lock on the container which has a Global Positioning System (GPS) inside. Secure, tamper-proof and you can be sure that what is inside stays inside and what is outside does not get inside. There is no need for the customs officers to inspect the box over and over again. The owner can track where the box is, all the time, 24/7. So with IE Singapore’s support, Ascent has taken to East Africa and there are more 10,000 iSpots in East Africa. From Kenya to Uganda, it used to take 20 days to travel because there are ten checkpoints to clear along the way. Each time you wait and you may have to grease palms.

Fortunately, not so successful, but still a couple of people died. In Malaysia, there was a grenade attack in Puchong, near Putrajaya, in June. It was ordered by a Malaysian militant in Syria. But even long before this, the Malaysian authorities knew they had problems because they had arrested around 200 ISIS supporters, including at least 13 Malaysian Armed Forces (MAF) personnel. Armed forces people, trained and pre-trained. Last month, Malaysia found that seven prison wardens had been radicalized by their detainees. You lock up a chap up, the chap subverts your jailor. The wardens had to be sent for de-radicalization. It reminded me of what happened in the 1950s when we locked up the pro-communist left-wing activists and they did the same thing. They subverted their jailors in Changi Prison. That is why we had to change the jailors and put in Gurkha guards, do not speak Chinese and so cannot be subverted. There are perhaps 1,000 Malaysians and Indonesians in the Middle East fighting with ISIS. It is enough for ISIS to form a Bahasa-speaking battalion. It is called the Katibah Nusantara, or the Archipelago Battalion, meaning the Malay Archipelago. One of the leaders is Bahrun Naim, an Indonesian. The one who ordered the Christmas and New Year attacks in Jakarta. ISIS has a magazine, Al-Fatihin, published by a media agency which is its friend, in Bahasa Indonesia. We have had to ban that magazine recently. ISIS itself puts out propaganda videos in Bahasa. It shows child fighters training with firearms. These are children of Malaysian and Indonesian fighters, and it shows the Malaysian and Indonesian fighters beheading hostages on the video so as to impress possible recruits and get more people to join them from Southeast Asia.",last december  the indonesians were expecting attacks over christmas and new year  they had intelligence on it  they went out of their way to pick up  arrest the groups and disrupt the attacks  they nearly succeeded  they picked up all of the groups  cleaned up all the terrorist cells  except one  and that one cell evaded the dragnet  in january  they mounted an attack in jakarta  fortunately  not so successful  but still a couple of people died  in malaysia  there was a grenade attack in puchong  near putrajaya  in june  it was ordered by a malaysian militant in syria  but even long before this  the malaysian authorities knew they had problems because they had arrested around isis supporters  including at least malaysian armed forces  maf  personnel  armed forces people  trained and pre trained  last month  malaysia found that seven prison wardens had been radicalized by their detainees  you lock up a chap up  the chap subverts your jailor  the wardens had to be sent for de radicalization  it reminded me of what happened in the 1950s when we locked up the pro communist left wing activists and they did the same thing  they subverted their jailors in changi prison  that is why we had to change the jailors and put in gurkha guards  do not speak chinese and so cannot be subverted  there are perhaps 000 malaysians and indonesians in the middle east fighting with isis  it is enough for isis to form a bahasa speaking battalion  it is called the katibah nusantara  or the archipelago battalion  meaning the malay archipelago  one of the leaders is bahrun naim  an indonesian  the one who ordered the christmas and new year attacks in jakarta  isis has a magazine  al fatihin  published by a media agency which is its friend  in bahasa indonesia  we have had to ban that magazine recently  isis itself puts out propaganda videos in bahasa  it shows child fighters training with firearms  these are children of malaysian and indonesian fighters  and it shows the malaysian and indonesian fighters beheading hostages on the video so as to impress possible recruits and get more people to join them from southeast asia,"{'neg': 0.141, 'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.048, 'compound': -0.9877}",-0.9877,Negative

Can I get SERS – the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme? SERS is a very good scheme for estate rejuvenation. It brings new residents into the estate, often young families, who inject vitality into the community. I have two SERS projects in Teck Ghee, and recently I visited Teck Ghee Parkview. It replaced the BTO blocks which came into the SERS site. The new flats have made a noticeable difference to Teck Ghee – the estate is livelier, more children are running around, more young couples like this one whom I visited. It has cheered up the neighbourhood. Now we have more babies in Teck Ghee, some even able to dance with their mothers. So yes, SERS is indeed one option, if your flat happens to be SERS-ed and selected. But SERS is a very limited scheme. It is meant for selected HDB blocks or precincts, which have high development value which we can unlock. What does that mean? Take Tanglin Halt for example. It is in Queenstown. It is our first HDB township. It was not built optimally. The precincts were not always well laid out. There are low rise flats, the flats have layouts where there are large surface car parks, empty spaces, odd leftover spaces. So if you take it all back and redevelop it completely, Tanglin Halt is being SERS-ed, you can use the space better, you can create denser housing, greener environments. So from something like this, you can go to something like this, 40 years’ change or 50 years change. We are redeveloping Tanglin Halt through SERS, using the space better, and creating denser housing and greener environments. It makes economic sense in such cases for the Government to take back the flats early and redevelop the site.

2018_eng.txt,72,"So what about the flats that do not get SERS? Well, HDB has been studying this intensively, and I have good news to share tonight. More households will be able to benefit from redevelopment before their leases expire. Why? Because the Government has good reason to take back more flats, and redevelop them as they grow older, before 99 years are up. Let me explain. When HDB towns grow older, and the leases in the estates are nearing expiry, we have to redevelop the towns. We want to do this in an orderly way. In the early years, because of the housing shortage, HDB often built in a tremendous rush. Several older estates were built within short periods, especially in the 1970s and 1980s.   Marine Parade between 1974-1976 – within three years. Ang Mo Kio and Bedok, after that, 1975-1981 – within six to seven years. This one is Marine Parade. Therefore, if we do not plan ahead, 99 years later, all the leases in such towns will expire around the same time, and all the flats will be returned to the state within a few years. We will have to find new homes for a lot of people at once. HDB will have to tear down and rebuild the old flats in a hurry, just like when we first built Marine Parade, Ang Mo Kio and Bedok. I do not think that is a good idea. The towns will become construction sites all over again, with cranes all over the place. I think we should redevelop our old towns over 20 to 30 years, rather than within four to five years, progressively. That means starting when the oldest flats reach about 70 years old onwards. So some flats, you redevelop when you get to 70 years old, some 75, some 80 and you stretch it out over 20, 30 years and progressively do things in a measured and considered way. Then, just like with SERS, the estate and the community can be renewed progressively. There will be more new and younger residents moving in and the estate will become more vibrant. Those moving out will have somewhere to go to, and those staying will have rejuvenation to look forward to. This is why it makes sense for the Government to take back flats progressively over several decades, starting from about 70 years onwards, and stage out the redevelopment.",so what about the flats that do not get sers  well  hdb has been studying this intensively  and i have good news to share tonight  more households will be able to benefit from redevelopment before their leases expire  why  because the government has good reason to take back more flats  and redevelop them as they grow older  before years are up  let me explain  when hdb towns grow older  and the leases in the estates are nearing expiry  we have to redevelop the towns  we want to do this in an orderly way  in the early years  because of the housing shortage  hdb often built in a tremendous rush  several older estates were built within short periods  especially in the 1970s and 1980s    marine parade between 1976   within three years  ang mo kio and bedok  after that  1981   within six to seven years  this one is marine parade  therefore  if we do not plan ahead  years later  all the leases in such towns will expire around the same time  and all the flats will be returned to the state within a few years  we will have to find new homes for a lot of people at once  hdb will have to tear down and rebuild the old flats in a hurry  just like when we first built marine parade  ang mo kio and bedok  i do not think that is a good idea  the towns will become construction sites all over again  with cranes all over the place  i think we should redevelop our old towns over to years  rather than within four to five years  progressively  that means starting when the oldest flats reach about years old onwards  so some flats  you redevelop when you get to years old  some  some and you stretch it out over  years and progressively do things in a measured and considered way  then  just like with sers  the estate and the community can be renewed progressively  there will be more new and younger residents moving in and the estate will become more vibrant  those moving out will have somewhere to go to  and those staying will have rejuvenation to look forward to  this is why it makes sense for the government to take back flats progressively over several decades  starting from about years onwards  and stage out the redevelopment,"{'neg': 0.01, 'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.063, 'compound': 0.9594}",0.9594,Positive

2019_eng.txt,41,"The Government will do its best to support older workers and the businesses that employ them. Last year, the Ministry of Manpower, MOM, set up a Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers to study the issue. I met the Workgroup members last month for lunch. They told me they had had intense discussions. Even at lunch, the discussion was quite intense. Why? Older workers wanted to be certain of continued employment for longer. When can I retire later? Can I be reemployed longer? Can I be reemployed more years at a time? But employers were worried about business costs and the uncertain economic outlook, and they said “I support you, I understand your aspirations, but I need more flexibility. Because I do not know what will happen. If I go broke, your job is gone too.” In the end the Workgroup reached consensus. 
They made four key recommendations. First, to raise the Retirement Age from 62 today to 65. Second, to raise the Re-employment Age from 67 today to 70. Third, to increase CPF contributions for older workers. Fourth, to achieve all this in gradual steps, by about 2030. I think these are sensible recommendations. The Government accepts them in full. Let me explain them in a little more, and I will start with CPF contributions, which is a little more complicated. Today, CPF contribution rates for workers begin to taper down after the workers turn 55. We will raise the rates for workers above 55. We will take the first step in 2021. And we will take subsequent steps after that. The whole process will take 10 years or so, about there, but it depends on economic conditions.

2019_eng.txt,52,"In the 1960s and 70s, floods were common in Singapore, especially during the rainy season. That is why Uncle Ng Ah Chye from Jalan Kayu, whom I told you about earlier, had to rescue stranded residents whenever it flooded. When we had high tides, monsoon drains in low-lying parts of Singapore would fill up almost to the brim, even if it was not raining. And if it did rain, it would flood. Gan Kim Yong told me when he was a child, his family lived in Hong Kong Street in Chinatown, where his father ran a shop. This is Temple Street, but it looked like this also. When there was an exceptionally high tide, which happened a few times a year, the tide water would rise up from the drains onto the five-foot way in front of the shop even without rain. So his father had to build racks to stack up his goods, out of reach of the water. To Kim Yong, who was then a boy, this was great fun. But actually it was a serious matter. These old flooding problems are now largely resolved. We improved the drainage system. We required buildings to be built on higher platforms, at least three metres above the mean sea level. Three metres sounds a lot because most of us are less than two metres tall. But three meters is not actually that high, because at high tide, the water can go up as high as two metres above the mean sea level. That leaves just a one metre buffer to cope with other factors. For example, heavy rain. If it rains, it fills up a little bit and the water has some where to go. Because of this one metre buffer, we have managed to deal with our flooding problems thus far. But, with global warming, if sea levels rise by one metre, our buffer is gone. Because when it is high tide, two metres above that, water is already reaching the five-foot way. Because if heavy rain coincides with a high tide, the water will have nowhere to go. We will, literally, be in deep water!

In particular, the Labour Movement and NTUC MPs have pushed for anti-discrimination laws that carry penalties. The government has held back, because we did not want the process to become legalistic or confrontational.  It is better if disputes can be resolved amicably, through persuasion or mediation but after consulting the tripartite partners, we have decided to adopt the Labour MPs’ suggestions. We will enshrine the TAFEP guidelines in law. This will give them more teeth and expand the range of actions we can take. We will model our approach on how we deal with another class of disputes: those over salaries or wrongful dismissal. In such disputes, conciliation and mediation are tried first. Only when those fail, does the matter go before an Employment Claims Tribunal, which will arbitrate and decide the case. We will create a similar Tribunal to deal with workplace discrimination. This will protect workers against discrimination based on nationality whether you’re Singaporean or non-Singaporean. It will also prohibit other kinds of discrimination covered by TAFEP. Women will get better protection and discrimination based on age, race, religion, and disability will also be disallowed. Philosophically, writing TAFEP guidelines into the law is a major move.

2022_eng.txt,68,"Let me give you one example: the biomedical sciences. Like so many important projects in Singapore, the story started with Dr Goh Keng Swee. In the 1980s he saw the potential of biomedicine, and Dr Goh set up the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB). Not everyone was persuaded. Some called it Goh’s Second Folly (the first was Jurong Industrial Estate. That one succeeded and this one they called it his second folly. They were not convinced. But we started. In the 1990s, we decided to make a big push on biomedicine. Mr Philip Yeo became Chairman of the National Science and Technology Board (NSTB), which later we renamed A*STAR. We scoured top universities and research institutes for the best biomedical scientists, researchers, engineers. Philip went round the world to pitch to them personally. He persuaded some of the top names in their fields – he called them the whales – as well as younger rising stars. They were taken by our vision, and they moved here. They moved their labs here, they moved their students here. They moved their team here. They did good work here. The whales mentored our local talents, who were then still new to the field – Philip called our local talent guppies – we awarded scholarships to hundreds of guppies, to study biomedical sciences all the way to PhD. The guppies trained under the whales, with the goal that one day they themselves would grow into whales. So, we created an eco-system for the bio-medicine business, and started on a long journey to become a biomedical hub. Our early guppies have matured. Homegrown scientists are now doing cutting-edge R&D. Quite a few have become principal researchers, leading their own teams. Others have founded startups, to develop and commercialise their discoveries. Today, our biomedical sector is thriving. It employs 25,000 workers and contributes almost one fifth of our manufacturing GDP. We have also attracted major projects, including from Sanofi and BioNTech – these are leading firms for vaccine manufacturing facilities. BioNTech is the second half of Pfizer-BioNTech, the vaccines which many of us have taken for Covid-19. It is a German company. When I met Chancellor Merkel last year before she retired, she says, I hear BioNTech is going to Singapore. They take note. It is significant. It means something to them. It means a lot to us. During COVID-19, our researchers – both Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans – made significant contributions. They helped maintain the international GISAID database, which facilitates sharing of COVID-19 genomic data worldwide. They developed test kits and other diagnostics. They enabled us to understand international progress on vaccine development, tap into industry networks, and thus secure vaccines and therapeutics early for our people. That is why we had the know-how, we had the confidence, we were prepared to take bets. We placed bets early and our bets paid off. We were able to vaccinate Singaporeans months before we would otherwise have been able to, saving time, saving lives, making a huge difference to Singapore. Had we not sought out top talent 30 years ago, then continued to build up our biomedical research teams and activities, and develop home grown talent, all this would never have happened.

Now, with borders re-opening, people are travelling again. Passenger traffic has already exceeded half of pre-COVID-19 levels.
