Last year, I described our modern Malay community � successful, forward looking, playing a full role in nation building and at the same time maintaining its customs and way of life. I am deeply encouraged that with each passing year, our Malay community is making more progress.

When the tsunami struck our neighbours last December, Singaporeans responded promptly to help.� Our SAF and Civil Defence teams brought relief and hope to the survivors.� Our volunteer groups also mounted a big effort.� We rendered help where it was needed, and when it was needed.

One important reason we succeeded was because we had servicemen and volunteers who spoke Malay, and understood the Malay language and culture.� We could communicate with the Acehnese, understand their needs, and work with the local authorities.� This experience brought home the importance of non-Malay Singaporeans too understanding Malay.� Now that more schools are teaching Malay as a third language, I hope more students will take it up.

The Malay community have made significant progress.� The community is on track to achieve its goal of 90% of each cohort making it to post-secondary education.� Already many Malays are taking up subjects such as the life sciences and multi-media.� More are becoming confident and successful professionals and executives.�

One great success is in tackling drug abuse.� This used to be a grave problem.�� In 1995, 3,000 Malays were arrested for drug abuse, more than half the total number of arrests.� Ten years later, the number of cases has dropped drastically.� In the first half of this year, only 40 Malays were arrested for drug abuse.

This is an enormous achievement.� I congratulate the Malay community and its leaders for surmounting the problem, and the volunteers in the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA), SANA, Mendaki, AMP, Pertapis, Jamiyah, Taman Bacaan and others who have done so much to rehabilitate drug addicts.�

I should especially mention the late Cikgu Harun Ghani.� He made this his personal mission, and put his heart and soul into the fight.� His total commitment and deep sincerity moved many drug addicts to turn over a new leaf, and contributed greatly to the ultimate success.� His recent passing was a loss to Singa�pore.� I am sure you will agree with me that Cikgu Harun should become an example to inspire a new generation of activists, to commit themselves to uplift their community and country.
We won the war on drugs because we brought the matter out into the open, discussed it frankly, acknowledged the problem, and then mobilised the whole community to tackle it.� This was also how we raised the educational achievements of Malay pupils in schools. I know many Malays were uncomfortable at this approach, as they felt under the spotlight.� But had we not done this we would not have solved the problem.

This evening, I want to raise one other issue which is as difficult as the drug problem, and as sensitive.� Most Singa�poreans have coped well with the economic changes.� But a minority are down and out, with no skills or jobs.� They have left school without completing their secondary education.� Many end up unemployed, with young families they are unable to support.
 
In Meet-the-People sessions, MPs often meet such hardship cases.� They have multiple problems.� There is no stable family unit.� The father is absent or in jail, and the mother is bringing up several young children alone.� They cannot support themselves or pay their utility bills.� The children do poorly in school, and then the cycle may continue into the next generation.

This is not a new problem, nor is it special only to the Malay community. But it affects the Malay community more than the Indians or Chinese because more Malays marry young and divorce early.� For example, last year 18% of Malay brides were below the age of 21, compared to only 9% of Indian and 3% of Chinese brides.� ����

We need to help these families stand on their own feet, not just through financial assistance but more importantly through counselling to change attitudes and behaviours.� Malay social organisations have self-help programmes to rescue these families from poverty.� Community leaders and MPs, including Malay MPs, help by tapping CDC resources and ComCare programmes.� They have raised funds to assist premature school leavers to gain basic skills and become more employable.�

I have discussed this with Minister Yaacob Ibrahim and the Malay MPs.� They are very concerned, and have shared the problem with other Malay leaders.� They see the need for a more concerted effort to tackle this challenge.� They asked me to bring it out into the open so that we can make progress solving it.�

The next Community Leaders� Forum will be held in November.� I urge the participants to study the facts, analyse the problem thoroughly, and work out concrete programmes to tackle it.� The lives and futures of young men and women and their children are at risk.� The whole community will have to pitch in.� We have to ensure that our sons and daughters stay in school and get their qualifications.� This will give them a much brighter future.� The government will extend full support.� But only with the personal involvement and intervention of community leaders will we able to change the situation, as we did when we overcame the drugs problem.�

We should see this problem against the backdrop of the �many achievements of the Malay community.� We must not be demoralised by it.� I am confident that the Malay community can overcome this problem, just as it has succeeded in raising education standards and in reducing the drug problem.� We can and will help the needy in all our communities, including the Malays, to progress.� At the same time we will create opportunities for the able and strong to fly high.�

Apart from community issues, Malay Singa�poreans share the same concerns as other Singa�poreans.� We have to remake Singa�pore thoroughly � upgrading our economy, improving the education system, strengthening our service culture, and building a vibrant global city. This requires the combined efforts of the whole nation.

I am optimistic about our future, and the future of the Malay/ Muslim community.� Asia is doing well.� We are fostering ties with the Middle East, especially the Gulf States.� Our knowledge of Malay and Islamic culture will help us to make friends and do business in the region.�

Malay Singa�poreans should hone their skills and experience to participate fully in tackling Singa�pore�s challenges, and to take full advantage of the abundant opportunities around us.� This is the way to realise our vision of a Community of Excellence.� Let us work together to raise Singapore and the Malay community to the next level.
